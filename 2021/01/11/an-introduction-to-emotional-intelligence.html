This course can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-emotional-intelligence/">here</a>. Given below are the raw notes I took while attending this course.</p> <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3> <ul> <li>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a way to combine thinking and feelings in order to make better/creative decisions and to build authentic relationships. It helps us with dealing with or controlling emotions too.</li> <li>an example EI response would be: praise in public, criticize in private</li> <li>EI is a set of social and emotional skills to <ul> <li>understand and express oneself</li> <li>develop and maintain meaningful social relationships</li> <li>cope with challenges in life</li> </ul> </li> <li>EI and IQ are NOT correlated <ul> <li>IQ is a measure of how smart you are</li> <li>EQ (Emotional Quotient) is a measure of how well can you use that smartness</li> <li>EI typically grows with age, whereas IQ growth peaks at ~17yrs</li> <li>aka EQ is a measure of EI</li> </ul> </li> <li>EQ refers to the quantifiable aspects of EI</li> <li>EI mainly deals with inter and intra personal skills which are important for personal success</li> <li>We should enjoy and use our emotions for our best, not become enslaved by them</li> <li>basic emotions (from Paul Ekman) <ul> <li>happiness</li> <li>fear</li> <li>anger</li> <li>sadness</li> <li>disgust</li> <li>surprise</li> <li>contempt (was added later)</li> </ul> </li> <li>more complex emotions are formed by mixing of these (just like colors)</li> <li>even though these are the basic ones, everyone “feels” about their emotions differently and it is essential that we learn to pin-point the correct one</li> <li>Plutchik’s wheel of emotions shows a nice interaction between basic emotions</li> <li>EI at work is NOT about <ul> <li>supressing emotions (but about raising those emotions and working with them)</li> <li>being nice (but about doing the right thing and making the right decisions)</li> </ul> </li> <li>how you think about a situation depends on how you feel and vice-versa. Thus emotional management and engagement are very essential</li> <li>giving feedback <ul> <li>feedbacks should help not hurt</li> <li>provide constructive criticism</li> <li>ask before they tell</li> <li>be honest and specific</li> </ul> </li> <li>receiving feedback <ul> <li>listen</li> <li>don’t make excuses or deny</li> </ul> </li> <li>emotions are always involved when we interact with everyone, even while trying to access from our memories</li> <li>poor ability to read other’s emotions leads to poor social skills</li> <li>emotions are higher-order states that momentarily pass through limbic region <ul> <li>conscious experiences are observed in the cortex region</li> <li>unconscious inputs come from limbic region as inputs to cortex region to become conscious experiences</li> </ul> </li> <li>just looking at an image to read another person’s image is not enough and we’ll require some more context at times <ul> <li>people with Mobius syndrome will appear to have a mask-like face</li> <li>so, we cannot judge a person’s emotions just by looking at their face alone</li> <li>some expression of emotions are cultural even</li> </ul> </li> <li>emotions <ul> <li>are a complex set of feelings</li> <li>cause physical/physiological changes</li> <li>alter our thought process and behavior</li> <li>are highly subjective</li> </ul> </li> <li>there are no positive/negative emotions, it is the thought process and behavior that they trigger which require such labels <ul> <li>happiness can’t be expressed in all occassions, eg: funeral</li> <li>happiness can’t help during negotiation or critical thinking</li> <li>anger can be used to right a wrong</li> <li>sadness helps us to be thankful and move on from our loss</li> <li>fear helps us avoid taking unnecessary risks</li> </ul> </li> <li>understanding and working with emotions <ul> <li>we should recognize what kind of events/circumstances generate what kind of feelings in us</li> <li>we should develop the capacity to generate the right emotions in order to focus, reason and communicate</li> <li>identifying how we feel and how others feel</li> <li>what kind of music/art makes me happy/calm/sad etc</li> <li>learn to to detect real vs fake feelings</li> </ul> </li> <li>Daniel Goleman’s framework for EI <ul> <li>motivation - drive to work and succeed (some people are motivated by money)</li> <li>self-awareness - understanding of ones strengths and weakness</li> <li>self-regulation - managing one’s own emotions (think before you act)</li> <li>empathy - understanding from another’s PoV</li> <li>social skills - working with others</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                   Awareness             Action
