title:  Contrastive Learning
---
Contrastive learning is a paradigm of self-supervised learning.

It is inspired by humans' ability to identify objects even without us having to
remember what those objects look like. This is done by us storing the high-level
features and ignoring microscopic details. It works by learning similar and
dissimilar data points. One way it does this is through data augmentation.
