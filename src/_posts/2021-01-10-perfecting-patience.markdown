### Introduction
In this book Dalai Lama discusses the Buddhist practices for perfecting patience
and tolerance, to help overcome anger and hatred. But I found that all the
techniques that he shows here can be practiced by Buddhists and non-Buddhists
alike. This book can be found
[here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576117/perfecting-patience-by-the-dalai-lama-translated-by-thupten-jinpa/).

### Summary
#### the challenge of patience
- a moment of anger can destroy the lifetime of merit - Shantideva
  - at first this sounds far fetched and extreme, but if you take into account
    the ripple effects of anger, this is certainly true
- patience cannot be practiced in isolation but in our day to day interaction
  with other people
- patience can only be developed once we have some control over our anger
- three characteristics of patience are tolerance:
  - based on conscious acceptance of pain and hardship, which helps in
    understanding others pain and suffering and be compassionate towards them
  - resulting from reflecting on the nature of reality. The more we are attached
    to something the more likely we get angry if we perceive a threat to it. We
    need to realise that the actions of others are never done in isolation but
    are related to the complex interdependencies in this world.
  - towards injuries from others. In reality, you cannot separate the person
    from the circumstance that caused him to injure you and only hate him or get
    angry at him. Shantideva goes a step further and asks us to consider these
    enemies as very precious, since they are the ones who can help us practice
    patience!
- there's no evil like hatred. There's no fortitude like patience
- often the fuel for the anger is some form of discomfort. Finding this
  connection is the first step towards controlling anger

#### day one
- compassion is a state of mind which is non-violent, non-aggressive and
  non-harming.
- one aspect of compassion is to respect others' rights and their views.
- hatred is pure evil as it involves having ill-will against others. Whereas
  anger can be beneficial some times especially when it is fuelled by compassion
- state of mind is crucial to enjoying our physical health, wealth and
  friendship we have.
- The only thing that protects us from the destructive effects of anger and
  hatred is tolerance and patience
- to practice tolerance and patience is to seek the causal factors/conditions
  responsible for the origin of anger and hatred, then eliminate those instead
  of directly trying to go against these strong emotions
- our natural tendency is to dislike suffering and like pleasure. So, any
  discomfort/suffering physical or mental will eventually invoke nager and
  hatred
- there are only few causes for happiness, but many for suffering. So it is
  better for us to increase our tolerance for suffering
- eg: by being able to tolerate smaller harms, we can prepare ourselves to
  tolerate greater ones in future
- hatred, anger and attachment are rooted in ignorance

#### day two
- unwholesome actions are the ones done through undisciplined state of mind, and
  vice-versa
- practice of patience and tolerance; love and compassion; complement and
  reinforce each other
- true hero is the one who gains victory over hatred and anger
- by meditating on suffering, one can develop empathy towards the others, which
  will in turn help us to be more patient and tolerant
- We hold grudge on animate objects and never on inanimate objects like
  illnesses, when the latter can equally do us harm. Just like the latter, the
  former could also have caused the ill-will or hatred that are out of their
  control
- imagine someone close to you losing temper and thereby turning into an "ugly"
  being. Then meditate on the effects of such an outrage and realise the
  importance of patience and tolerance
- many of the harmful acts are not done with malicious intent but out of pure
  ignorance or carelessness
- being angry at disturbed people who harm others is like getting angry at fire
  for burning
- being angry at people who harm when under circumstances out of their control
  is like blaming the sky for the overcast of clouds
- why should we only hate the person who hits us with a stick and not instead
  hate the stick and the circumstances that are also responsible for his act?
- we too might have similarly caused pain to others so it is just right that we
  too receive the same from others, right?
- one's pain is one's own creation
- many of us take petty things too seriously and things which have grave impact
  on us very lightly!
- if someone is insulting us, it doesn't cause bodily harm. So, why should our
  minds be bothered with such acts?
- imagine someone who gets on your nerves says something that irritates you.
  Further imagine your natural response to it and then observe the sequence of
  events that can unfold due to it. Now, meditate on what would have happened of
  you were to practice tolerance instead.

#### day three
- if the person who's at the recieving end of the harm also gets angry
  (ignorantly) with the perpetrator, then both these people are in the same
  category
- just like how we remove all the fire-spreading materials from a burning house
  to reduce its spread, we should also do similar thing in order to stop the
  spread of hatred. Eg: attachment is the root of hatred
- if one observes carefully, one can see that the reason all conflicts and
  fights arise even inside a family is because of strong attachment
- if we fall ill, worrying and feeling sorry for ourselves will only add
  additional mental burden
- we also cannot blame everything on karma and take a passive attitude towards
  life!
- visualize a person suffering badly. Now relate yourself to that person and try
  to share their suffering. Now make a resolution that you'll help all such
  sentient beings
- when we hear our enemies being praised by others, we shouldn't be angry or
  jealous about it. Instead we should feel happy that this enemy has atleast
  made someone else happy
- if we expect others to be happy when we are praised, then it's logical to
  reciprocate the same when others are being praised too
- worrying when our fame/recognition decline is just like children who cry when
  their sandcastle topples down
- our ultimate goal is the freedom from suffering. We shouldn't be distracted
  from it due to material gain and honor
- there are opportunities for practising generosity but very few for patience.
  So we need to be grateful when there are enemies who inflict harm onto us
- in your meditation practice the act of give-and-take. Visualize a very
  afflicted individual and give him all your successes whereas take all his
  sufferings

#### day four
- interaction with sentient beings are very much needed for us to practice
  tolerance and patience.
- thus one can argue that we should value sentient beings more than the Buddha's
  for their contribution towards our perfection of these virtuous values
- in your meditation, practice thoughtlessness. By default our mind is always
  focused on external objects, because of sensory experience. Try to focus
  inward. Since there's no object to focus on, there's always the chance of
  falling asleep! Start by concentrating on your breath and then do meditation.
- a childish compassion is one where we are compassionate towards the sufferings
  of sentient beings but when we come across successful people we become envious
  of them
- people with worldly success are plagued by mental/emotional pains whereas the
  poor are plagued by physical pains
- this is because we are all under the power and influence of ignorance!
- meditate on the concept of "self". Self is an aggregation of all our
  experiences. There's always a difference between what we perceive and what the
  reality is. The conclusion here is that things are not independent or inherent
  as we think of them as. But instead, things are dependent on other factors.
  This is what is meant by meditating on emptiness.
