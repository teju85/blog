Introducing [ML Glossary](https://teju85.github.io/ml-glossary/) which tries to
provide a glossary of all ML terms used. This started out as a way for me to
quickly access the meaning of a term. Then realized that putting it out there
should also help others.

It also open-source so that anyone can contribute to improving its content. This
project is currently hosted on github [here](https://github.com/teju85/ml-glossary).
Comments, Issues and PR's are welcome!
