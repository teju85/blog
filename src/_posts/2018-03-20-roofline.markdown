### Summary
Slides of the talk can be found [here](http://crd.lbl.gov/assets/pubs_presos/parlab08-roofline-talk.pdf)

#### The Roofline Model
- realistic expectations of perf and productivity
- show inherent h/w limitations for a given kernel
- potential benefits and priority of optimizations
- computation is free, communication is expensive

#### principal components of performance
- they are:
  - computation (Gflops/s is of main interest)
  - communication (GBps is of main interest)
  - locality (maximize locality to minimize communication)
- each architecture and kernel has different balance between these

#### arithmetic intensity
- relates computation with communication
- flops to bytes ratio
- to measure total bytes, all caches should be considered

#### roofline
- upper bound to perf is given by
  - achieved flops/s = min(peak flops/s,  streaming-BW * flops-to-bytes-ratio)
  - assume complete overlap of computation with communication
- provides intuitive graph for kernel analysis and optimization
