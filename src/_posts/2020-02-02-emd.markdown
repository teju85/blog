### EMD - A Metric for distributions with applications to image databases
Summary of the article found [here](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~tomasi/papers/rubner/rubnerIccv98.pdf).

- proposes a distance metric - EMD - Earth Mover's Distance
- instead of fixed size bins (aka histograms), they propose generic versions
  called signatures
  - a signature is a tuple - $$(m_j, w_j)$$
  - $$m_j$$ = mean value of the cluster center
  - $$w_j$$ = weight of (or number of points in) the cluster
- then, EMD is defined as a solution to the flow problem:
  - $$\sum_i \sum_j c_{ij} * f_{ij}$$
  - $$c_{ij}$$ = distance between 2 signatures i and j
  - $$f_{ij}$$ = flow from source signature distribution to the destination
  - $$f_{ij}$$ >= 0
  - $$\sum_i f_{ij} = y_j$$
  - $$\sum_j f_{ij} \leq x_i$$
- if $$\sum_j y_j != \sum_i x_i$$, choose the one with higher summation to be
  the source distribution
- $$EMD(x,y) = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j c_{ij} * f_{ij}}{\sum_i \sum_j f_{ij}}$$
- OR $$EMD(x,y) = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j c_{ij} * f_{ij}}{\sum_j y_j}$$
- if weights of 2 distributions and their signature counts are same, then this
  is a true metric
- but by nature of above equations, it can allow partial matches
- finally, solving this is a special case of transportation problem
  - where the graph is bipartite
  - this is being solved using the simplex method
