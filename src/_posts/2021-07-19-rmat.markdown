### Proposal
Main paper can be found [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/PUBLICATIONS/siam04.pdf).

* recursive and procedural approach to building real-world-like graphs
* Erdos-Renyi model becomes a special case of this approach (with a = b = c = d = 0.25)
* proposes an AutoMAT-fast parameter fitting algorithm
* generates graphs with:
  - power-law distribution
  - directed, undirected or bipartite properties
  - very efficient $$O(E log(E) log(N))$$ complexity
  - can also generate "winner does not take all" kind of graphs too
  - generate communities (and also sub-communities within communities)
  - smaller diameter (proved experimentally in this paper)

### Summary
- Parameters:
  - $$N$$ - number of nodes in the graph
  - $$E$$ - number of edges in the graph
  - $$2^n$$ - number of nodes in the RMAT graph (where $$n = ceil(log2(N))$$)
  - $$a, b, c, d$$ - probabilities of each quadrant in the adjacency matrix
  - $$a + b + c + d  = 1$$
- Typically: $$a \ge b$$ and $$a \ge c$$ and $$a \ge d$$
- Main algo
  - pick the quadrant based on the probabilities $$a, b, c, d$$
  - keep doing this until we hit the "leaf node" which is the pair of nodes which
    will get an edge
  - repeat this until we have $$E$$ edges
- to smooth out fluctuations in the degree distributions, these probabilities are
  perturbed (and renormalized) slightly at each level
