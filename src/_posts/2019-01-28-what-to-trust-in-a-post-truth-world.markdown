### What to trust in a 'post-truth' world
By Alex Edmonds. The recorded TED talk can be found [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_edmans_what_to_trust_in_a_post_truth_world/up-next).
Alex talks about how confirmation bias could lead us astray in the current
world. He then provides a very compelling argument, urging us to consider data
and evidence very consciously.

### Summary
1. Confirmation bias - we accept stories that match our beliefs and reject those
   that don't. This is especially true in politics, business and health.
2. We need to check if the data supports the theory, but instead we end up
   checking of the data is consistent with the theory!
3. This consistency is alone not sufficient, because the same data could also be
   consistent with the rival theory! (Due to confirmation bias, we'll never
   check for this)
4. Because of this bias we also accept a fact as data. And also accept data as
   evidence, even if it consistent with rival theories.
5. Data is a collection of facts. Evidence is the data that supports one theory
   while ruling our others.
6. A story is not fact, because it may not be true.
7. A fact is not data, because it might not be representative.
8. Data is not evidence, because it might be consistent with rival theories.
9. Actively seek out for rival points.
10. Play devil's advocate with your decisions/theories.
11. Pause before sharing anything!
12. Only if it's true, it can be a fact. Only if it's representative, it can be
    data. Only if it's supportive, can it be evidence.
