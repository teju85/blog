### Proposal
Main paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08026v2).

* ML based method to predict energy solutions from the Schroedinger equation
* Use symmetry adapted atomic orbitals + graph neural networks as their
  architecture for this purpose
* This architecture is called as OrbNet

### Summary
- This is a regression model that is being learnt through DL techniques
- Regression targets themselves are quantum mechanical energies
- the GNN model will have edge and node attention built into it
-
