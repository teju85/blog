[Here](https://gist.github.com/teju85/2cfc3934f3697aaff324b77e693010a0) is a
short c++ code to solve the popular 3x3 sudoku puzzle. Follow the instructions
at the top of the source file to compile and run the code. It only uses the
logical elimination-based method to converge to the right solution. This appears
to solve even the "hard" problems from [websudoku](https://websudoku.com) portal.
