Carnegie walks us through a list of time-tested rules/ideas/guidelines to help
us stop our greatest enemy, worry. When you have gone through this list, you'll
realize that this is nothing novel and everyone before us have been trying to
tell us the same thing! However, the uniqueness in his book is that he shows us
the examples from real people who have been able to put some of these techniques
in order to conquer their worries.

### intro
- leadership gravitates towards those who can stand up and speak what they are
  thinking

### live in "day-tight compartments"
- Thomas Carlyle: our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance,
  but to do what lies clearly at hand
- today's bread is the only kind of bread you can possibly eat. By all means
  prepare for tomorrow, but don't have anxiety about it
- anyone can do their job or handle their responsibilities for one day
- everyday is a new life to a wise man

### a magic formula for solving worry situations

### how to analyse and solve worry problems
- six honest men: what, when, why, how, where and who - Rudyard Kipling
- basic steps in problem analysis
  - get the facts
  - analyze the facts
  - come to a decision and then act on it
- confusion is the chief cause of worry
- if one gathers all the facts in an objective way, the problem usually solves
  itself!
- it is hard to collect facts when our emotions are running high due to worry.
  So, do this:
  - think that you are collecting these facts for another person
  - now pretend that you are a lawyer trying to bring you down and collect all
    facts against you
- a problem well stated is problem half solved
- but once the decision has been made, don't self-doubt

### how to eliminate 50% of your business worries
- answer these questions:
  - what is the problem?
  - what is its cause?
  - what are all the possible solutions?
  - what solution do you recommend?

### how to crowd worry out of your mind
- keeping yourself busy can drive out anxiety
- remember: idle mind is devil's workshop!
- worried person must lose himself in action, lest be wither in despair

### don't let the beetles get you down
- we often face the most difficult hardships with extreme courage, but always
  let us down due to silly trifles!
- only few of us are greatly wronged. It is the small hurt to our ego which lead
  to fights and murders
- a giant tree withstands centuries of avalanche and storms, only to be brought
  down due to incessant attacks by tiny insects and beetles!
- don't dwell on trifles. Life is too short to be little.

### a law that will outlaw many of your worries
- most of our worries are due to imagination
- when you find yourself worrying about some possibility ask yourself, what's
  the chance of it happening

### co-operate with the inevitable

  consequences of a misfortune
- circumstances alone do not make us happy or unhappy, but our reactions.
- it's only miserable of we cannot endure our circumstances
- this doesn't mean we should shy away from adversities! It means when we have a
  chance a fighting back we must.

### put a "stop-loss" order on your worries
- just like we put a stop-loss order on the purchased shares to minimize loss,
  we should do the same on our worries, impatience, etc.
- things happen, but we shouldn't be paying them back at the cost of our peace
  of mind.
- most of our miseries are due to the false estimates we have on things
- when you find yourself worrying too much, ask yourself:
  - what is it worth to me
  - at what price should I put a stop-loss order on it
  - have I already paid enough

### don't try to saw sawdust
- there's only one way to benefit from our past, ie to calmly analyze it for any
  mistakes, benefit from it and forget it!
- don't cry over spilt milk!
  - all the fuss and cry in the world will not bring back that milk
  - we can only try to avoid trying to get it spilt the next time
