### Teditor v1.6.0!
Glad to announce the release of the next version of teditor: v1.6.0. It
can be found [here](https://github.com/teju85/teditor/releases/tag/1.6.0).

### Changelog
Changes/features in this release:
1. grep mode
2. Support for working with remote files
3. Simplified indent/unindent logic
4. File history storage syntax update in light of remote file syntax
5. Enabled keep-lines/remove-lines command and also their undo/redo
6. Alert users about working on remote buffers
7. Case insensitive searching via a rc option
8. Various fixes to improve perf on remote buffers (eg: usage of DirCache)
9. Various bug fixes and addition of utility methods

### grep mode
This is similar to the grep mode in emacs. `M-x grep <enter>` type the regex
to search for and the file/dir where to search and then press enter. This should
open a buffer with all grep results highlighted. From then onwards, pressing
enter on each result of grep will take you to that file and line (similar to
what happens in grep mode of emacs).
