### Spartan Discipline
By Dominic Mann. This book can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805).
Mann gives tips, tricks, suggestions and analogies from Spartan's lifestyle
to illustrate how to develop self-discipline and be productive in our lives.

### Summary
- full bellies never plough fields
- choose delayed gratification over the instant one
- accept minimalism as it allows to inculcate lazer sharp focus, by eliminating
  distractions. For someone with no junk in kitchen shelf, eating healthy
  becomes easier.
- willpower is like muscle. More you exercise it, the stronger it becomes
- your body can stand almost anything. It's the mind that's the bottleneck
- Mind over matter!
- a healthy mind and body can go a long way in developing self-discipline
- external events are not under your control, but how you react to them is
- start with the end in mind (what do you want people to say at your funeral)
- conquering yourself is the first step to conquering the world.
- use your emotions as a tool rather than becoming a tool for them.
- Conquer your emotions, not the other way around!
- there are 2 kinds of wants
  - wants of the body
  - wants of the mind
- it is the wants of the mind that you truly want
- go all the way in or don't even start. Don't give yourself any exceptions, or
  else, those exceptions can become the norm.
- to make big gains avoid tiny losses
- it is through hardship, challenges and adversity that we grow in life
- developing discipline in one key area of life also leads to being disciplined
  in all areas of life. It's called developing a "keystone habit"
- Spartans used to not ask how enemies, but where they are. If you truly want to
  do something, find a way to do it.
- give your 100% in everything you do.
- do one thing at a time, but with lazer sharp focus. Intensity beats extensity
- you just only need enough willpower to get a habit in motion. Once habit takes
  over, no willpower is required
- we eventually get adjusted to new circumstances and get back to our normalcy.
  So we'll be just as happy with a disciplined life as we were if continued to
  be lazy and comfortable
