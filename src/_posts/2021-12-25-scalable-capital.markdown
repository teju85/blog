After my research on Scalable Capital (SC), as of 25.12.2021, these were some of
its features I came across, in no particular order:
* Allows moving your portfolio from other brokers like Trade Republic (TR). It
  doesn't involve any cost, but can take some time.
* In case you're switching countries (inside EU zone), they allow you to do so.
  However, TR, for eg, will not. But moving countries means your tax ID will
  change, and this you'll have to get it done only via writing to the customer
  support.
* Savings plan doesn't cost anything across all their different subscriptions.
  One can start in this plan with only 1 Euro as well!
* You can also create as many savings plans as you want
* In savings plan they also allow you to provide a SEPA debit mandate to
  transfer money from your current account to your brokerage account at regular
  intervals.
* You can quit the contract at any time
* SC has both mobile and laptop apps
* No extra cost for opening the account
* Transferring money from your current account to savings account can take more
  than a business day. So, one needs to factor that!
* They do TDS on your profits and submit it to the local income tax department
  and provide you with a tax report for filing purposes. No charges are applied!
* They keep their brokerage with Baader Bank
* Only supports investing in exchanges inside Germany (eg: if you're in Germany)
  unlike other neobrokers like flatex
* Allow you to setup Freistellungsauftrag to benefit from the Freibetrag (eg:
  801 Euros)
* You need to have a current account in the SEPA region in order to open an
  account with them. Most of the nationalities are supported, unlike TR.
* They offer 3 kinds of subscriptions:
  - Free Broker - No subscription fee, only pay when you buy/sell or have more
    savings plans
  - Prime Broker - 2.99 Euros per month (but paid annually), only pay when you
    buy/sell with orders less than 250 Euros
  - Prime Broker flex - 4.99 Euros per month (paid monthly), only pay when you
    buy/sell with orders less than 250 Euros
* If you are investing in Prime-ETF's directly, they don't charge any commission
  on the orders greater than 250 Euros, even under Free broker subscription.
  Irrespective of how many savings plan you have with any of ETF's from any
  prime partners
