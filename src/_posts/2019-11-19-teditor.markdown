### Teditor v1.5.0!
Glad to announce the release of the next version of teditor: v1.5.0. It
can be found [here](https://github.com/teju85/teditor/releases/tag/1.5.0).

### Changelog
Changes/features in this release:
1. Brand new Option interface to customize editor behavior via rc-file
2. Revamp of commandline parsing to print help message, pass rc-file, etc
3. Track version info from the commandline
4. Bug fixes to removeRegion functionality
5. Support in dir-mode for opening remote directories
6. Reorg of cmds and modes source files to something more aptly named locations

### Commandline options
From now onwards, commandline options for the editor are documented and can be
accessed via the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
teditor -h
{% endhighlight bash %}

### Customizing editor via rc files
Easiest way is to create a fresh rc file via the `-dump` option and then edit
it to customize as per your needs.
{% highlight bash %}
teditor -dump /path/to/rc/file
# open and edit this file
{% endhighlight bash %}
