### Proposal
This is my summary of the WalkSAT paper which can be found [here](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1994/AAAI94-051.pdf).

- Notes that GSAT spends a lot of time in "sideways" moves
- Proposes and compares the following 3 approaches
  - Simulated Annealing
  - GSAT + random walk
  - GSAT + random noise
  - WalkSAT
- Empirically they show WalkSAT does pretty well on hard SAT problems compared
  to complete solvers
- Authors also show that they can solve MAX-SAT problems with this solver too

#### Summary
- Simulated Annealing
  - $$\delta$$ = number of unsat clauses turning into sat
  - if $$\delta >= 0$$, flip the best such variable
  - else flip the variable with probability $$e^{-\frac{\delta}{T}}$$
- GSAT + random walk (mixed random walk strategy)
  - focus on only variables from unsat clauses
  - with probability $$p$$, pick a variable occuring in some unsat clause and
    flip its truth assignment
  - with probability $$1 - p$$, follow the standard GSAT scheme
- GSAT + random noise
  - same as previous approach but do not limit only to variables from unsat clauses
- Algo for WalkSAT is given below

```
for i = 1 : max_tries:
  sigma = random truth assignment for F
  for j = 1 : max_flips:
    if sigma satisfied F return sigma
    C = a random unsatisfied clause from F
    if for a variable x in C which has break-count = 0"
      v = x  // freebie move
    else:
      if biased coin toss with probability p:
        v = a random variable in C  // random walk move
      else:
        v = variable in C with smallest break-count  // greedy move
    flip v in sigma
return FAIL
```
