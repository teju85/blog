### PinSage - Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Web-ScaleRecommender Systems
Main paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01973.pdf) and a more
digestable version is presented in a blog format [here](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinsage-a-new-graph-convolutional-neural-network-for-web-scale-recommender-systems-88795a107f48).

#### Proposal
A scalable random-walk GCN to learn embeddings on attribute graphs with billions
of nodes. They demonstrate this on Pinterest's data with billions of nodes and
tens of billions of edges. They also present an efficient way to do inferencing
on the resulting model via MapReduce paradigm.

#### Details
Current GCNs expect the availability of full graph Laplacian during training.
This is very infeasible for web-scale graphs with billions of nodes and edges.
