This book can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Power-Gayatri-Mantra-potential/dp/9388423240).

### Summary
- we become the kind of people we surround ourselves with
- we speak our words carefully, use our resources judiciously to help ourselves
  and those around us and be eternally grateful for everything in our lives
- Om Swami starts with the story of how King Kaushika became Brahmarshi
  Vishwamitra and the sacred Gayatri mantra was revealed to him. More on this
  story can be read [here](https://sanjay-koul.blogspot.com/2015/04/sage-vishvamitra-gayatri-mantra.html?m=1)
  and [here](https://www.hinduscriptures.com/hindu-lifestyle/king-kaushika-sage-vishwamitra/31242/)
- few nice words of wisdom from sage Vasishtha to King Kaushika:
  - the one who does not seek or need anything from this world can create anything he wishes.
  - you are not defined by what you have or what you can do, but by who you are.
- there's little hope for a person who's dark from the inside
- When you are fulfilled, you can manifest fairly much anything in your
  life. Itâ€™s when we are not fulfilled that we become impatient; we become
  self-centered. We become tired and narrow-minded. In chasing what we could
  have had, we lose sight of what we already have
- Purity and light are synonyms of enlightenment, of freedom; while the impure
  is trapped and confined, the pure is eternally liberated
- four kinds of chanting
  - vachika - chanting out aloud. Can quickly tire you and also can cause
    restlessness when done over long periods of time
  - upanshu - only lip movements to be seen along with a whisper
  - manasika - it is not chanting the mantra in your mind, but actually
    recalling it
  - ajapa - a state where the mantra is chanting itself! 
- If you get upset very quickly, that means you are not progressing spiritually
- You chant a mantra because you want to invoke the divinity within; to gain
  immense inner strength; to constantly purify yourself.
- a good prayer never asks God for anything (that's actually begging!). It
  instead should only express gratitude
- 3 forms of mantra sadhana:
  - nitya karma - aka daily routine. Helps refresh what you've learnt
  - naimittika karma - sort of a FD in your spiritual bank account. You chant
    certain mantra for a certain number of times in a given period and store
    it's energy to be used later (aka purushacharana) 
  - kamya prayoga - chanting mantra for fulfilling certain desire
- when you are lazy, breathe from the right nostril and it'll invigorate you
- when you are angry, breathe from the left nostril and it'll clam you down
- different types of invocations:
  - laghu purushacharana - duration of 3-9 days with atleast 1k chanting each day
  - sadharana purushacharana - 40-120 days with a minimum total count of 100k.
  - asadharana purushacharana - 18-24 months with an exact total count of 2.4M
  - maha purushacharana - 24-32 months with an exact total count of 3.2M
    comprehensive invocation has full 36 steps while the brief one has only 7
