### Teditor v1.0.0!
In [an old post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-24-teditor %}) of
mine, I had announced Teditor, a terminal based editor completely written in
C++. Today, I'm glad to announce the release of its next version: v1.0.0. It
can be found [here](https://github.com/teju85/teditor/releases/tag/1.0.0).

### Changelog
Changes/features in this release:
1. Completely revamped command interface, so that users don't have explicitly
   encode undo/redo commands. This makes writing of commands/extensions much
   easier.
2. Every new command can be made to self-document and now there's a help command
   to query just that!
3. Fixes to many bugs in editing commands, especially with active regions.
