I"v<p>Summary of <a href="http://mghassem.mit.edu/insights-word2vec/">this</a> blog post on word2vec.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SGNS form of word2vec is the best performing method</li>
  <li>word2vec can be seen as a matrix factorization of PMI matrix
    <ul>
      <li>Pointwise Mutual Information</li>
      <li>it basically performs a weighted factorization, so might as well be better than SVD</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CBOW good when having less data, SGNS good when having more data
    <ul>
      <li>CBOW smooths the learning function to regularize</li>
      <li>but data is the ultimate regularizer!</li>
    </ul>
