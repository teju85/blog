<p>By Alex Edmonds. The recorded TED talk can be found <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_edmans_what_to_trust_in_a_post_truth_world/up-next">here</a>.
Alex talks about how confirmation bias could lead us astray in the current
world. He then provides a very compelling argument, urging us to consider data
and evidence very consciously.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Confirmation bias - we accept stories that match our beliefs and reject those
that donâ€™t. This is especially true in politics, business and health.</li>
  <li>We need to check if the data supports the theory, but instead we end up
checking of the data is consistent with the theory!</li>
  <li>This consistency is alone not sufficient, because the same data could also be
consistent with the rival theory! (Due to confirmation bias, weâ€™ll never
check for this)</li>
  <li>Because of this bias we also accept a fact as data. And also accept data as
evidence, even if it consistent with rival theories.</li>
  <li>Data is a collection of facts. Evidence is the data that supports one theory
while ruling our others.</li>
  <li>A story is not fact, because it may not be true.</li>
  <li>A fact is not data, because it might not be representative.</li>
  <li>Data is not evidence, because it might be consistent with rival theories.</li>
  <li>Actively seek out for rival points.</li>
  <li>Play devilâ€™s advocate with your decisions/theories.</li>
  <li>Pause before sharing anything!</li>
  <li>Only if itâ€™s true, it can be a fact. Only if itâ€™s representative, it can be
data. Only if itâ€™s supportive, can it be evidence.</li>
</ol>
