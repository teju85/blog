<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>
<ul>
  <li>PET - short for Pranic Energization Technique.</li>
  <li>It is the usage of Prana Shakthi to energize our entire body</li>
  <li>It is an advanced form of yoga</li>
  <li>Prana (life) manifests itself in 5 functional forms in our body:
    <ul>
      <li>Prana - which controls upper body and respiration</li>
      <li>Apana - which controls lower body and excretion</li>
      <li>Samana - controls abdominal region and digestion</li>
      <li>Udana - controls upwards movements like belching, vomiting, etc</li>
      <li>Vyana - one which controls touch and is all through the body</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="breath-awareness">Breath awareness</h4>
<ul>
  <li>first step towards realizing Prana Shakthi in PET.</li>
  <li>respiration involves 3 phases
    <ul>
      <li>inspiration aka Puraka</li>
      <li>hold aka Kumbhaka</li>
      <li>expiration aka Rechaka</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>start by noticing the breath (to recognize any imbalances or irregularities)
    <ul>
      <li>sit in any comfortable position or Shavasana</li>
      <li>start watching the breath at the top of the nose</li>
      <li>recognize any imbalances in breath (eg: breath flow between 2 nostrils), but
don‚Äôt control them</li>
      <li>observe breath becoming continuous, regular and smooth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>just the act of observing these imbalances helps in reducing them</li>
  <li>it is believed that left nostril breathing promotes right-lobe of brain and
vice-versa. In yoga:
    <ul>
      <li>left nostril breathing implies Chandra Nadi Prana flow, which is soothing in
nature</li>
      <li>right nostril breathing implies Surya Nadi Prana flow, which is energizing
in nature</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nadi Shuddhi Pranayama
    <ul>
      <li>a balancing technique for breathing</li>
      <li>take up Sthiti posture</li>
      <li>adopt Nasika Mudra in right hand</li>
      <li>inhale through left nostril while closing right nostril with the thumb</li>
      <li>enjoy the Kevala Kumbhaka</li>
      <li>open the right nostril and exhale while closing the left nostril via the
ring and index fingers</li>
      <li>enjoy the Kevala Kumbhaka</li>
      <li>repeat vice-versa on the other side</li>
      <li>repeat the whole thing for 9 rounds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Kapalabhathi
    <ul>
      <li>for folks with nasal blockage or observing drowsiness during Nadi Shuddhi
Pranayama can instead practice this</li>
      <li>cleanses respiratory tract and stimulates brain cells</li>
      <li>sit in Vajrasana or Padmasana</li>
      <li>adopt Nasika Mudra in right hand</li>
      <li>close right nostril with the thumb and breathe in fully through the left
nostril while bulging the abdominal muscles (aka diaphragmatic breathing)</li>
      <li>close the left nostril with little and ring fingers. Open the right nostril</li>
      <li>exhale with a burst as fast as possible by sucking in abdominal muscles</li>
      <li>repeat vice-versa on the other side</li>
      <li>repeat the whole for 60 rounds (at a speed of 60 rounds per minute)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cautions with Kapalabhati practive
    <ul>
      <li>always do this under empty stomach only</li>
      <li>don‚Äôt contort facial muscles</li>
      <li>don‚Äôt twist nostrils</li>
      <li>don‚Äôt practice if: having high BP, IHD, slip disk, under menstruation, under
pregnancy, spondylosis, etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="awareness-and-relaxation">Awareness and relaxation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>improving awareness and sensitivity
    <ul>
      <li>start with pointed awareness (aka attention)</li>
      <li>carefully trace the movement of breath from nose tip all the way to the lungs
and back. Feel the coolness of air while inspiration and warmness during the
expiration.</li>
      <li>reach a stage of maintaining continuous line of awareness through the path of
breathing</li>
      <li>gradually expand this linear awareness to the inner surfaces of the entire
respiratory tract</li>
      <li>notice that the breathing stops during end of inhalation and start of
exhalation and vice-versa (aka Kevala Kumbhaka). This induces deep rest and
relaxation</li>
      <li>we can now start feeling our heart beat, pulses in blood vessels. This is the
state of 3D awareness, over the entire body</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bhramari Pranayama
    <ul>
      <li>while exhaling produce a humming sound, like a bee</li>
      <li>elongate the duration of humming/breathing without disturbing the flow</li>
      <li>enjoy the Kevala Kumbhaka and the sound vibrations throughout the body</li>
      <li>repeat for 9 times</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resonance in Bhramari is the key thing. We should adjust our frequency of the
produced sound so as to feel the resonance throughout the body.</li>
</ul>

      <li>Naga Bandha</li>
      <li>Cakra</li>
      <li>Shiva Linga</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recognition of nerve impulses - in PET Adi, Cin, Cinmaya and
Namaskara mudras are used for this purpose
    <ul>
      <li>sit in a comfortable position and relax the whole body</li>
      <li>place hands on thighs and adopt Cin mudra</li>
      <li>observe pulse and heart beat sync</li>
      <li>open the fingers in Cin mudra and touch again, now recognize the nerve
impulses going from fingers to the brain</li>
      <li>now adopt Cinmaya mudra</li>
      <li>press and release the other fingers and feel the impulses (repeat 9 rounds)</li>
      <li>adopt Adi mudra and repeat this press and releas process</li>
      <li>similarly adopt Namaskara mudra and repeat</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recognition of Vyana: nerve impulses is always unidirectional, to the brain
and they travel at a fixed speed. Vyana has none of these limitations.
    <ul>
      <li>move the palms in and out, bring the palms as close as ~2cms gap between.
Feel that region between the palms getting sensitized. We are experiencing
Vyana in this space. Now rotate both palms clock and anti-clock wise in
order to churn Vyana.</li>
      <li>it is this perception of Vyana that will be utilized to energize our systems
and also to improve our immune system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
