<p>This very popular book by Stephen Covery teaches the seven habits that we all
must inculcate to lead an effective and fruitful life. This book can be found
<a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Habit1 - Be proactive. Focus on things you can control</li>
  <li>Habit2 - Begin with the end in mind. Define a clear goal that is aligned with
your life’s mission.</li>
  <li>Habit3 - Put first things first. Prioritize the tasks apriori, instead of
reacting to urgent things.</li>
  <li>Habit4 - Think win-win. Life is not a zero-sum game.</li>
  <li>Habit5 - Seek first to understand, then to be understood. Which helps in
influencing others by deeply understanding their PoV and needs.</li>
  <li>Habit6 - Synergize. Whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
  <li>Habit7 - Sharpen the saw. Spend time in renewing your skills, acquiring new
ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<h3 id="foreword">foreword</h3>
<ul>
  <li>interdependence is a higher value than independence</li>
  <li>we achieve success only when we are in harmony with the principles that govern
the success itself</li>
  <li>some of our most difficult challenges are:
    <ul>
      <li>fear and insecurity (of the future) - and we become more risk-averse. But to
succeed we need to be interdependent in this complex world</li>
      <li>“I want it all now” mentality - we need to balance between short term and
long term growth</li>
      <li>blame and vicitimism - we should own our mistakes and work towards
rectifying them</li>
      <li>hopelessness - caused by believing that we are the victims</li>
      <li>lack of balance in life - we need to have priorities and defend them fiercely</li>
      <li>what’s in it for me? - we seem to treat everything in life as a competition.
We should work selflessly with mutual respect for mutual benefit</li>
      <li>hunger to be understood - we want to be understood, but we aren’t ready to
deeply listen to others</li>
      <li>inability to cope with conflicts and differences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paradigms-and-principles">paradigms and principles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>our perceptions govern the way we see, which in turn govern the way we behave</li>
  <li>pre-WWI, success was defined by character ethic: integrity, humility, fidelity,
temperance, courage, industry, patience, simplicity, modesty, etc</li>
  <li>post-WWI, success was defined by personality ethic: public image, behaviour,
attitude, skills, techniques. Those which lubricate the process of human interaction</li>
  <li>elements of personality ethic are essential for success. But for long term,
continued success character ethic is critical</li>
  <li>what you are speaks louder than what you do</li>
  <li>paradigm is the way we perceive the world. It is like having a map. If our map
itself is wrong, no matter of we improve our behavior or attitude, we’ll still
end up at a wrong place</li>
  <li>we have many mental maps or paradigms in us. They are of 2 main categories:
    <ul>
      <li>the way things are (reality)</li>
      <li>the way things we want things to be (values).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we see things in this world not as they are, but as we are!</li>
  <li>conditioning can very powerfully affect our perceptions and paradigms</li>
  <li>when others disagree with our views,  we immediately think that something’s
wrong with them</li>
  <li>the way we think and act are based on the assumption that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reality == values</code>!</li>
  <li>it is futile in the long run, to change our attitudes and behaviours without
understanding the underlying paradigms which gives rise to these.</li>
  <li>where we stand depends on where we sit. If we have a clear and objective pov
about a thing, there could similarly be another clear and objective pov about
the same thing and it might as well be just as right as yours!</li>
  <li>paradigm shifts bring in very powerful changes in us and our society, for
better or for worse.</li>
  <li>some paradigm shifts are long and require deliberate processes in place because
paradigms are inseparable from character</li>
  <li>many of us experience paradigm shifts when we face life-threatening situation
or take on a new role in life/work</li>
  <li>paradigms are the lens through which we see our world</li>
  <li>principles are not values. If principles were to be the territory, values
would be the map.</li>
  <li>it takes time for a baby from rolling over till the time it starts to walk
and run. This is true for all walks of life.</li>
  <li>trying to take shortcuts from these natural processes only results in
frustration and disappointment</li>
  <li>admission of ignorance is often the first step in education</li>
  <li>to relate effectively with other humans, we first need to learn to listen
properly</li>
  <li>often times, the way we see the problem is the problem!</li>
  <li>the more we look for quick-fixes, the more problems they’ll cause in the
long term</li>
  <li>personality ethic only teaches us to look for such quick fixes</li>
  <li>significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we
were at when those problems were created - Einstein</li>
  <li>we need to change our paradigms, characters and motives completely in order to
solve these problems</li>
  <li>
    <p>this is the inside-out approach. We should start within ourselves first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We are what we repeatedly do. This excellence is not an act but a habit</li>
  <li>our character is a composite of our habits</li>
  <li>habits are like the pull of gravity. They are very difficult to break</li>
  <li>habit is formed through the intersection of what to do (knowledge), how to do
(skill) and the want to do (desire)</li>
  <li>happiness is the ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want
eventually</li>
  <li>maturity - it is the growth of an individual from dependent to independent to
interdependent.</li>
  <li>
    <p>interdependence is about us cooperating among each other for something greater
than ourselves. This is the mark of a true leader or a team player</p>
  </li>
  <li>effectiveness lies in maintaining the “P/PC balance”</li>
  <li>remembering Aesop’s golden goose story, we need to make sure that we give
adequate attention to both the production and the production capacity</li>
  <li>in our life
    <ul>
      <li>production = the results</li>
      <li>production capacity = the asset producing the results or the ability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>three kinds of assets are
    <ul>
      <li>physical - P is the purpose of this asset (eg: car for transport) and PC is
its timely maintenance.</li>
      <li>financial - our most important asset here is our own capacity to earn (P).
If we don’t invest in ourselves (PC), we’ll end up with limited options.</li>
      <li>human - P/PC balance here is even more critical, as people control both
physical and financial assets!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in every interaction or relation, figure out your goose and its eggs. Then
earnestly work towards its P/PC balance</li>
  <li>PC principle is to treat your employees exactly the same way as you want them
to treat your customers</li>
  <li>no one can persuade another to change. It can only happen from within</li>
  <li>self-growth is the greatest investment, but it’ll be evolutionary, whereas
it’s results will be revolutionary</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="private-victory">private victory</h3>
<h4 id="habit-1---be-proactive">habit 1 - be proactive</h4>
<ul>
  <li>self-awareness is unique to us and we can use this very same thing to make and
break our habits</li>
  <li>we can also use this to examine our paradigms and check whether they are based
on reality/principles or are they based on conditioning.</li>
  <li>there are 3 social maps that are used to determine the nature of man
    <ul>
      <li>genetic determinism</li>
      <li>psychic determinism</li>
      <li>environmental determinism</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>however, can these factors be the sole reason to define a man’s nature?</li>
  <li>
    <p>Victor Frankl’s story goes along to show that between stimulus and response,
is our freedom (no matter the circumstances!) to choose the latter</p>
  </li>
  <li>being proactive means knowing that we are responsible for our own lives</li>
  <li>our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions</li>
  <li>we are by nature proactive. So if we become reactive in the process, it’s
because we have let external circumstances to control us!</li>
  <li>highly proactive people don’t blame outside things for their behavior. They
know that it is due to their own conscious choice, which is based on values
not feelings</li>
  <li>they have the ability to subordinate an impulse to a value</li>
  <li>what matters the most is how we respond to what happens to us in life.</li>
  <li>most of the times, we know about what needs to be done. But only a few of us
are willing to take the initiative to get it done</li>
  <li>use your R and I (resourcefulness and initiative)</li>
  <li>to be effective, we need to act and not be acted upon</li>
  <li>this requires us to be proactive about what’s our response to the situation
should be</li>
  <li>examining our own language can tell us a lot about our mental maps and our
paradigms</li>
  <li>reactive people always absolve themselves from responsibility</li>
  <li>
    <p>eg: reactive people treat “love” as a feeling, something beyond their control.
Proactive people see it as a verb. Something one does, the sacrifices one
makes for their loved ones</p>
  </li>
  <li>circle of concern (CoC) - list of things that we get concerned about</li>
  <li>circle of influence (CoI) - things in CoC over which we have our influence</li>
  <li>proactive people focus on CoI, thereby increasing their CoI</li>
  <li>however, reactive people focus on CoC, thereby further shrinking their CoI</li>
  <li>by working on ourselves instead of the conditions, we will be able to
influence the conditions</li>
  <li>having CoI to be larger than CoC is also an indication of myopic and reactive
nature of that person too!</li>
  <li>the problems we face fall into 3 categories:
    <ul>
      <li>direct control - involve our own behavior. Can be solved by working on our
habits</li>
      <li>indirect control - involve other people’s behavior. Can be solved by working
our influence</li>
      <li>no control - we cannot do anything about them. Eg: our past. Solved by just
accepting them by their face value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>oh god… give us the courage to change the things which we can change,
maturity to accept the things which we can’t and the wisdom know the difference</li>
  <li>first step in solving all these problems lies in our CoI</li>
  <li>by choosing how to respond to our circumstances, we can greatly influence
the outcome</li>
  <li>CoC is filled with the “have”s</li>
  <li>CoI is filled with the “be”s</li>
  <li>anytime we think that the problem is “out there”, that thought is itself the
problem!</li>
  <li>we are free to choose our actions, but cannot choose the consequences of
those.</li>
  <li>if we chose a wrong response and if we now regret about it, then that’s a
mistake.</li>
  <li>thus, both consequences and mistakes are part of our CoC.</li>
  <li>to be proactive, it is important to admit our mistakes instantly, learn from
them and correct ourselves.</li>
  <li>proactivity is mainly governed by our ability to make and keep commitments and
promises.</li>
  <li>this also gives us courage to be responsible for our own lives</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="habit-2---begin-with-the-end-in-mind">habit 2 - begin with the end in mind</h4>
<ul>
  <li>what lies behind and before us is nothing compared to what lies within us</li>
  <li>it is easy to work harder and climb the success ladder, only to see that it is
finally leaning against the wrong wall.</li>
  <li>it is possible to be very busy without being effective</li>
  <li>by keeping end in mind, we have a clear destination, a core set of values in
mind, that guide us everyday along a clear path</li>
  <li>all of us create things twice: first in our minds and then physically</li>
  <li>if we don’t consciously design this thing in our mind first, then we’ll end up
having other people or circumstances to dictate it for us</li>
  <li>
    <p>if habit 1 says “you are the creator”, then habit 2 is the first creation</p>
  </li>
  <li>management is doing things right and leadership is doing the right thing</li>
  <li>
    <p>more often parenting and also our personal lives, we are into day-to-day
managing rather than thinking about where we are headed</p>
  </li>
  <li>having a personal mission statement is very helpful (as it is determined by
keeping end in mind)</li>
  <li>at the center of your CoI is your personal mission statement. It is then
expanded by working on these 4 interdependent factors:
    <ul>
      <li>security - your sense of worth</li>
      <li>guidance - your source of direction in life</li>
      <li>wisdom - your perspective on life</li>
      <li>power - your capacity to act</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>by starting to work on these factors, you gradually expand your CoI</li>
  <li>many of us center our lives on wrong things. Eg. Self, spouse, family, work,
money, possession, church, etc. Maybe even combination of these things and
over time. Solely depending on these factors to derive our sense of self-worth
can hurt our security, guidance, wisdom and power.</li>
  <li>
    <p>our sense of security, guidance, wisdom and power are drawn from these centers
which are not derived intrinsically, but from external sources</p>
  </li>
  <li>hence, it always is superior to live life centered around principles that don’t
change under circumstances</li>
  <li>this should be the center of all the other centers mentioned above.</li>
  <li>with being principle centered, you don’t act based on people or circumstances.</li>
  <li>most of us tend to dominantly use only one half of our brain. We need to
cultivate the habit of assessing the situation and accordingly using the right
tool to solve it</li>
  <li>specifically, our world is becoming increasingly reliant on left-brain usage.</li>
  <li>to change our behavior, use the affirmation process. Vividly imagine the scenario
and then script out your behavior during that scenario. Repeat this exercise for
multiple days.</li>
  <li>define your roles and goals in each of your role. They’ll help provide a clear
structure and direction to your personal mission statement</li>
  <li>if there’s no involvement, then there’s no commitment</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="habit-3---put-first-things-first">habit 3 - put first things first</h4>
<ul>
  <li>things which matter the most must never be at the mercy of things which matter
the least</li>
  <li>manage from the left, lead from the right</li>
  <li>organize and execute around priorities</li>
  <li>there are 4 kinds of activities on which we spend our time:
    <ol>
      <li>important-and-urgent</li>
      <li>important-but-not-urgent</li>
      <li>not-important-but-urgent</li>
      <li>not-important-and-not-urgent</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To be an effective self-manager, your discipline should be a function of your
independent will</li>
  <li>Effective people stay in the quadrant 2. They also completely avoid not-important
tasks (Q3 and Q4)</li>
  <li>effective people are not problem-minded but are opportunity-minded</li>
  <li>by staying in Q2, we think ahead and prevent problems from being crises (thereby
moving to Q1)</li>
  <li>to be able to spend more time on quadrant-II we should learn to say “no” to other
things, even the apparently urgent ones</li>
  <li>by centering on the wrong things, we keep getting pulled into Q1 and Q3 all
the times</li>
  <li>a Q2 oriented tool should focus on
    <ul>
      <li>being coherent - with P/PC balance, personal mission statement</li>
      <li>maintain balance - between all your roles</li>
      <li>focus on Q2 - thus instead of scheduling daily, it should help plan on a weekly basis</li>
      <li>add a people dimension - as sometimes we have to surrender our schedules to people</li>
      <li>flexible - tool is your servent, not the other way around</li>
      <li>portable - easy to carry around</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>organizing for Q2 involves:
    <ul>
      <li>identifying roles</li>
      <li>defining goals for each role as per priority</li>
      <li>scheduling tasks weekly</li>
      <li>adapting the tasks daily</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>be effective with people and efficient with things</li>
  <li>so, at times we have to submit our schedules for a higher purpose. But since we
will be principle driven, we should be able to do so with ease.</li>
  <li>key to effective management is delegation</li>
  <li>trust is the highest form of human motivation, but it takes time and patience</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="public-victory">public victory</h3>
<h4 id="paradigms-of-interdependence">paradigms of interdependence</h4>
<ul>
  <li>you can’t be successful with others if you aren’t successful with yourself</li>
  <li>building relationships is a time-consuming process
    <ul>
      <li>understand the individual</li>
      <li>attending to the little things</li>
      <li>keeping commitments</li>
      <li>clarifying expectations</li>
      <li>showing personal integrity</li>
      <li>apologize sincerely when you make a withdrawal from the emotional bank account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>when you defend those who are absent, you earn the trust of those who are present</li>
  <li>it is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor for
the salvation of the masses</li>
  <li>in interdependent situations, every P problem is a PC opportunity</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="habit-4--">habit 4 -</h4>
<ul>
  <li>you can’t get the fruits of cooperation from a paradigm of competition</li>
  <li>you can’t change the fruit without changing the root</li>
  <li>different approaches in human interaction:
    <ul>
      <li>win/win - seeks mutual benefit of all involved parties. Very essential when
the environment is highly interdependent</li>
      <li>win/lose - most of us are primed with this competitive mentality. This
prohibits cooperation</li>
      <li>lose/win - seekers of acceptance. But it makes them cynical and depressive</li>
      <li>lose/lose - typically happens when 2 win/lose people confront each other</li>
      <li>win - one who always wants to win. doesn’t necessarily care about whether
other person loses or wins</li>
      <li>win/win or no deal - if both parties can’t come to a mutual agreement it is
better to walk away.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>which approach to use always depends on the situation. However lose/lose is
just not viable. If this situation is about interdependence then win/win is the
best, but with the option of walking away if no conclusion can be reached</li>
  <li>many times we think of win/lose or lose/win as win/win. It is very important
to accurately identify them as these can cause problems later</li>
  <li>five dimensions of win/win
    <ul>
      <li>character - integrity (with our core values), maturity (balance between
courage and consideration) and abundance mentality (there’s enough out there
for everybody)</li>
      <li>relationships
        <ul>
          <li>through strong character we develop healthy relationships</li>
          <li>this matters a lot when dealing with a win/lose person</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>agreements
        <ul>
          <li>definition and direction to win/win results</li>
          <li>win/win agreement has 5 elements:
            <ul>
              <li>desired results (not methods)</li>
              <li>guidelines or frameworks within which the above results are to be produced</li>
              <li>resources to help accomplish the results</li>
              <li>accountability to track performance and evaluate success</li>
              <li>consequences of evaluation (good/bad)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>it can only come out through successful character and relationships</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>systems - reward systems must be aligned with the goals and values</li>
      <li>processes - win/win results are achieved through processes that are defined
in habits 5 and 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="habit-5---seek-first-to-understand-then-to-be-understood">habit 5 - seek first to understand, then to be understood</h4>
<ul>
  <li>all of us learn how to read, write and speak. However, very few of us listen!</li>
  <li>we listen with an intent to reply!</li>
  <li>levels of listening
    <ul>
      <li>ignoring</li>
      <li>pretending</li>
      <li>selective</li>
      <li>attentive</li>
      <li>empathic (seeking first to understand, without any judgement)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>sympathy means to agree with the person, whereas empathy is to fully
understand them without necessarily having to agree with them</li>
  <li>what is satisfied will not motivate us</li>
  <li>next to physical survival is psychological: to be understood, to be affirmed
and validated</li>
  <li>diagnose first before you prescribe</li>
  <li>because if you don’t have confidence in the diagnosis, you won’t have
confidence in the prescription</li>
  <li>if we listen always from our PoV, we either only:
    <ul>
      <li>probe - ask questions from our frame of reference</li>
      <li>evaluate - agree or disagree</li>
      <li>advise - based on our experience</li>
      <li>interpret - figure our people, their motives etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>when emotions are involved such a logical left brain approach will only end up
emotional bank withdrawal!</li>
  <li>skills (tip of the iceberg of empathic listening):
    <ul>
      <li>mimic content - literally</li>
      <li>rephrase the content - in your own words</li>
      <li>reflect feeling - focus on what the other person is really feeling</li>
      <li>reflect and rephrase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in order to work with the vast differences between our perceptions it helps
when we seek first to understand</li>
  <li>finally, knowing how to be understood is also equally important in arriving at
win/win solutions</li>
  <li>seek to understand requires consideration</li>
  <li>to be understood requires courage</li>
  <li>right sequence for an effective presentation is: ethos (character), pathos
(feeling) and logos (logic)</li>
  <li>when you listen, you learn</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="habit-6---synergy">habit 6 - synergy</h4>
<ul>
  <li>synergy means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts</li>
  <li>it means to respect the differences, build on the mutual strengths while
compensating for each other’s weaknesses</li>
  <li>working without synergy is like driving with one foot on brake and the other on gas</li>
  <li>uniformity doesn’t mean unity!</li>
  <li>essence of synergy is in recognising differences and valuing them</li>
  <li>in order to achieve interpersonal synergy once must first perfect intrapersonal
synergy (eg: approaching life from both left and right brains)</li>
  <li>because life is not just logical, it is also emotional</li>
  <li>remember “we all see the world as we are, not as it is”</li>
  <li>it is possible that we both the see the same situation but have different opinions
on it and yet both be correct</li>
  <li>for any change there’ll be:
    <ul>
      <li>driving forces; which are positive, logical, reasonable, economical</li>
      <li>restraining forces; which are negative, illogical, emotional, psychological</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>unless we work directly on these restraining forces, just the driving forces
aren’t enough. It’s like pushing against a spring!</li>
  <li>you can be synergistic with yourself even in a hostile environment. Eg: you don’t
have to take insults personally</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="renewal">renewal</h3>
<h4 id="habit-7---sharpen-the-saw">habit 7 - sharpen the saw</h4>
<ul>
  <li>following are the 4 dimensions of renewal:
    <ul>
      <li>physical - exercise regularly in order to build endurance, flexibility and
strength. It also helps us to be more proactive.</li>
      <li>spiritual - renewal of spirit, people do it very differently: prayer,
meditation, music, etc. “greatest battles of life are fought daily in the
 silent chambers of soul”</li>
      <li>mental - continually educate yourself. We shouldn’t let our minds atrophy.
Write regularly about your thoughts and feelings</li>
      <li>social/emotional - to help sharpen the saw for habits 4,5,6, in achieving
public victory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the person who doesn’t read is no better than the one who can’t.</li>
  <li>how are we reflecting to others? Is it just what they are or what they can be?
Sometimes, the way we treat or our belief in other people can have significant
influence in their lives</li>
  <li>to keep up with the upward spiral of renewal, we must continually learn,
commit and do; over and over.</li>
</ul>
