<ul>
  <li>requires only ~2n memory accesses</li>
  <li>achieves SOL on memory BW</li>
  <li>launch as many CTAs on the chip as the occupancy limits</li>
  <li>spread the work on these CTAs so as to cover the whole input array</li>
  <li>have each block compute upsweep phase of the prefix scan</li>
  <li>store the aggregate as well as inclusive prefix sum of these aggregates from preceding CTAs</li>
  <li>use a 3-valued ternary flag to indicate invalid/aggregate-done/prefix-done</li>
  <li>use this flag from preceding CTAs to compute the prefix-sum for this CTA to finish the task</li>
</ul>
