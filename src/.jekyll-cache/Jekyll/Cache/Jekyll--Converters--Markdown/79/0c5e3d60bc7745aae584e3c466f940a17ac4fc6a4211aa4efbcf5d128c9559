<p>By Dr. Herbert Benson. This book can be found

In this book, Dr. Benson writes about a response that is opposite to
‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response, which is called relaxation response (RR). He lists
the benefits of this response and simple steps to elicit this response.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Field of medicine can be construed as a 3-legged sturdy stool
    <ul>
      <li>medications</li>
      <li>surgery and similar medical procedures</li>
      <li>self-care</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>belief is potentially central to our health</li>
  <li>remembered wellness (aka placebo effect) also elicits RR</li>
  <li>2 step process in the mind/body technique:
    <ul>
      <li>elicit RR to quiet the mind</li>
      <li>after the mind has become quiet rewire the thoughts and actions in the
desired direction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>have a balanced approach to all 3 of the legs of this stool. When in doubt,
do consult your physician</li>
  <li>technology instead of easing our lives has only resulted in more stress</li>
  <li>we are frustrated that we can‚Äôt even solve simple problems like being on time,
due to congestion. Thus we become victims of stress.</li>
  <li>stress not only affects us mentally, but also physically.
    <ul>
      <li>hypertension is currently a worldwide phenomenon as well as an epidemic.
        <ul>
          <li>It is caused by
            <ul>
              <li>bad diet</li>
              <li>lack of exercise</li>
              <li>family disposition</li>
              <li>environmental stress</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>all animals respond to chronic stressful conditions via the
‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response (needed for survival)</li>
      <li>situations that demand we adjust our behavior elicit this response</li>
      <li>this response involves increased BP, shallow breath, increased heart rate.</li>
      <li>this response needs to be used, for eg, running away from or fighting with
the enemy. If it is not used, over periods of time, it can lead to
disastrous consequences, which is what is happening nowadays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the opposite of ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response is the RR
    <ul>
      <li>it reverses the adverse effects of ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response</li>
      <li>evoking RR is to be done via these steps
        <ul>
          <li>a quiet environment</li>
          <li>a mental device (a word, phrase or mantra) that should be repeated. This
repetition helps avoid distracting thoughts</li>
          <li>a passive attitude (by disregarding other thoughts and returning to the
mental device in case of any distraction). This is one of the key things
to elicit RR!</li>
          <li>a comfortable position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>the above process is also known as Transcendental Meditation, a refined yoga
practice developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the risk of developing atherosclerosis is directly related to the BP as well
as cholesterol levels</li>
  <li>HBP directly affects 3 organs: heart, brain and kidneys</li>
  <li>events which require adjusting of our behavior cause stress in us. A stressful
person is more susceptible to diseases and having more BP</li>
  <li>we simply cannot deal with the complexities the life throws at us. So, better
to learn effective ways to cope with those</li>
  <li>it has been shown now that through voluntary mental acts, one can control the
‚Äúinvoluntary‚Äù bodily mechanisms like BP, heart-rate, oxygen consumption,
(aka metabolism) etc.</li>
  <li>alpha waves are the brain waves which indicate the feeling of well-being</li>
  <li>major physiologic change due to meditation is the decrease in metabolism
    <ul>
      <li>aka hypometabolism</li>
      <li>only 3 things cause this: meditation, sleep or hibernation</li>
      <li>hibernation is shows a drop in rectal temperatures, meditation doesn‚Äôt</li>
      <li>sleep and meditation
        <ul>
          <li>in sleep metabolism decreases gradually until 4-5 hrs</li>
          <li>in meditation it decreases rapidly in the first 2-3 mins</li>
          <li>meditation increases alpha waves in brain</li>
          <li>meditation decreases blood lactate content (associated with anxiety)</li>
          <li>thus meditation and sleep can‚Äôt be substituted for one another!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>altered state of consciousness
    <ul>
      <li>RR is associated with this state</li>
      <li>it is one of the states in between coma -&gt; sleep -&gt; drowsiness -&gt; alert -&gt; hyper-alert</li>
      <li>this state needs to be purposefully evoked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>people going psychoanalysis sessions will find it hard to assume passive
attitude, thus difficult for them to elicit RR</li>
  <li>excessive daily elicitation of RR can lead to hallucinations due to sensory
deprivation</li>
  <li>within few weeks of stopping RR, our body typically goes back to its original
state, so better to be regular with this process</li>
</ul>
