<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>full bellies never plough fields</li>
  <li>choose delayed gratification over the instant one</li>
  <li>accept minimalism as it allows to inculcate lazer sharp focus, by eliminating
distractions. For someone with no junk in kitchen shelf, eating healthy
becomes easier.</li>
  <li>willpower is like muscle. More you exercise it, the stronger it becomes</li>
  <li>your body can stand almost anything. It‚Äôs the mind that‚Äôs the bottleneck</li>
  <li>Mind over matter!</li>
  <li>a healthy mind and body can go a long way in developing self-discipline</li>
  <li>external events are not under your control, but how you react to them is</li>
  <li>start with the end in mind (what do you want people to say at your funeral)</li>
  <li>conquering yourself is the first step to conquering the world.</li>
  <li>use your emotions as a tool rather than becoming a tool for them.</li>
  <li>Conquer your emotions, not the other way around!</li>
  <li>there are 2 kinds of wants
    <ul>
      <li>wants of the body</li>
      <li>wants of the mind</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>it is the wants of the mind that you truly want</li>
  <li>go all the way in or don‚Äôt even start. Don‚Äôt give yourself any exceptions, or
else, those exceptions can become the norm.</li>
  <li>to make big gains avoid tiny losses</li>
  <li>it is through hardship, challenges and adversity that we grow in life</li>
  <li>developing discipline in one key area of life also leads to being disciplined
in all areas of life. It‚Äôs called developing a ‚Äúkeystone habit‚Äù</li>
  <li>Spartans used to not ask how enemies, but where they are. If you truly want to
do something, find a way to do it.</li>
  <li>give your 100% in everything you do.</li>
  <li>do one thing at a time, but with lazer sharp focus. Intensity beats extensity</li>
  <li>you just only need enough willpower to get a habit in motion. Once habit takes
over, no willpower is required</li>
  <li>we eventually get adjusted to new circumstances and get back to our normalcy.
So we‚Äôll be just as happy with a disciplined life as we were if continued to
be lazy and comfortable</li>
</ul>
