<p>In this book Malcolm Gladwell, through series of real life incidents, shows that
more is not always better and less is not always bad; as paradoxical as it
sounds! Through various examples from history, he demonstrates the importance of
inverted U-curve while making decisions. He shows that depending on the vantage
point, what we usually perceive as advantages can turn out to be disdvantages
and vice-versa. This book can be found

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>
<ul>
  <li>sometimes, the strength of these giants can become the source of their weakness</li>
  <li>act of facing overwhelming odds can change people, but we often misinterpret it</li>
  <li>key points to note in this epic fight:
    <ul>
      <li>David was a slinger (artillery), whereas Goliath was an infantry. Slingers
always beat infantry.</li>
      <li>Goliath was expecting another infantry for a hand-to-hand battle and thus
was heavily armored, making him slow in his movements.</li>
      <li>David had no intention of doing so with no armor and so could maneuver
quickly.</li>
      <li>power comes not only in size but also with speed and surprise</li>
      <li>Goliath had an assistant to hold his shield, that was mostly because to
guide him as he couldn‚Äôt see. (He says, ‚Äústicks‚Äù when David was carrying
only one)</li>
      <li>Israeli army saw Goliath and jumped to conclusions about what he could do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-advantages-of-disadvantages-and-disadvantages-of-advantages">The advantages of disadvantages (and disadvantages of advantages)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>there are certainly advantages of having material resources. But there are
also equal advantages of not having those!- we have a very rigid definition of
what an advantage is and thus we find a David-Goliath event to be a surprise
always</li>
  <li>the underdog and the misfits have little invested in the conventions. Thus
they end up trying things that are unheard of</li>
  <li>most parents would love to enroll their children to schools with less crowd
because they are convinced that lesser students means more individual
attention from the teachers.</li>
  <li>however, many studies have found no correlation/causation between these two
things!</li>
  <li>just like children of poor struggle, the kids of the wealthy also struggle as
they are spoiled by the comfort and have lost their ambition</li>
  <li>so both the ends of the spectrum suffer and probably it‚Äôs somewhat better at
the middle</li>
  <li>thus the curve of easyness of parenting as a function of the parents‚Äô wealth
is an inverted U-curve!</li>
  <li>inverted U-curves are notorious in showing to us that doing/having more not
necessarily means more ‚Äúoutput‚Äù</li>
  <li>all positive traits and experiences have an inherent cost and at high levels
these costs will outweigh their benefits</li>
  <li>everyone of us want to compete fiercely in order to get into the finest
institutions</li>
  <li>have we ever considered that is it good for us to be small fish in a big pond
or a big fish in a small pond of our choosing!?</li>
  <li>in the big pond, there‚Äôs always a chance of experiencing ‚Äúrelative deprivation‚Äù.</li>
  <li>we form our impressions by comparing to folks ‚Äòin the same boat‚Äô, rather than
comparing globally</li>
  <li>and our impressions are the starting point for motivation and confidence</li>
  <li>the smarter your peers, the dumber you feel!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="theory-of-desirable-difficulty">theory of desirable difficulty</h4>
<ul>
  <li>we all want to avoid disadvantages as they can set us back. However there are
a few ‚Äúdesirable difficulties‚Äù which bring with them their own advantages</li>
  <li>eg: many of the successful entrepreneurs are dyslexic!</li>
  <li>if you have to overcome a hurdle, people do it better when we increase the
difficulty a bit.</li>
  <li>however, it should be duly noted that not all difficulties are desirable!</li>
  <li>most of us excel in the things that we are good at. Because we are good at
something, we like to do it more often and the more we do the better we get.
This is ‚Äúcapitalisation learning‚Äù. This is easy</li>
  <li>desirable difficulties on the other hand force you to compensate for what‚Äôs
lacking (aka ‚Äúcompensation learning‚Äù)</li>
  <li>thus what is learnt out of necessity is much stronger than what comes as easy</li>
  <li>the prediction of Londoners to the WWII German bombings were completely wrong.
People went with their daily business as if nothing had happened.</li>
  <li>basically there are 3 groups of people created by these bombings:
    <ul>
      <li>casualties - they are gone and can never cause panic</li>
      <li>near misses - the wounded or traumatized</li>
      <li>remote misses - these will start to feel a strange sense of invulnerability!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>and we all know self-confidence is the very father and mother of courage</li>
  <li>and in a big city like London, there were far more remote misses than near
misses</li>
  <li>too often we jump to the conclusion that there can only be one response to
traumatic experience. But from the above example it‚Äôs clear that there can be
two!</li>
  <li>gifted children and prodigies tend to come in highly supportive families
whereas geniuses grow up in adverse conditions</li>
  <li>courage is not acquired but earned through triumph against tough times</li>
  <li>affective forecasting - predicting how we feel about a future event. We are
pretty bad at it!</li>
  <li>moral of the Brer rabbit stories was that even the weakest can triumph in a
lopsided event if they were willing to use their wits- in other words, one
gets an unexpected freedom from having nothing to lose</li>
  <li>a trickster is not a trickster by nature, but by necessity. Necessity coming
out of playing a very unfair game</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-limits-of-power">the limits of power</h4>
<ul>
  <li>it‚Äôs been said that the revolutions are not caused by revolutionaries but by
the stupidity and brutality of the governments. And what happened in Northern
Ireland was just this</li>
  <li>we often think authority to be the answer to disobedience. But at times,
disobedience can itself be due to authority!</li>
  <li>when the people in authority want the rest to behave, it first depends on how
they behave</li>
  <li>principle of legitimacy:
    <ul>
      <li>people should have a feeling that their voices are being heard</li>
      <li>rules should be the same for all</li>
      <li>rules should apply to everybody the same way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>those who give orders are very vulnerable of the opinions of those who are
receiving their orders. Hence, legitimacy is highly needed</li>
</ul>
