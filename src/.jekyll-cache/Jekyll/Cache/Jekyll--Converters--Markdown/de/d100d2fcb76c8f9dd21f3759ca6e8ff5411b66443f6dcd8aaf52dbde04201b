I"ø<p>Introducing <a href="https://teju85.github.io/ml-glossary/">ML Glossary</a> which tries to
provide a glossary of all ML terms used. This started out as a way for me to
quickly access the meaning of a term. Then realized that putting it out there
should also help others.</p>

<p>It also open-source so that anyone can contribute to improving its content. This
project is currently hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/teju85/ml-glossary">here</a>.
Comments, Issues and PRâ€™s are welcome!</p>
