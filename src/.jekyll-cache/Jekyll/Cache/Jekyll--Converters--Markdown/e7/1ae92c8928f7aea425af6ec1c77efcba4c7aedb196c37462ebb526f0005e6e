<p>This is my notes after watching Dr. Sean Bradyâ€™s Keynote talk at LCA-2020. The full
recorded video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv4tI6939q0">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Expertise is certainly necessary for us to be better at our jobs and do less
mistakes. However, there are cases when expertise can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_priming">negatively prime</a>
us down the wrong solution path! He uses the examples of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/19/archives/new-jersey-pages-coliseum-roof-collapses-at-hartford-civic-center.html">Hartford convention center collapse</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Gulch_fire">Mann Gulch wildfire</a> to
show that in the moments of pressure we continue to cling onto our expertise
despite of all the warning signs to the contrary. In some scenarios, our
expertise itself can be the greatest source of negative priming since we use it
sub-consciously (and automatically) at all times!</p>

<p>When we end up trying to solve a problem thatâ€™s slightly outside our expertise,
even if we know that our â€œtoolsâ€ arenâ€™t giving us the right solution, we continue
to hold onto them (just like the firefighters of Mann Gulch did)! It is hard for
all of us to accept the fact that the tools we currently use are not the right
ones for the job.</p>

<p>Some nice quotes from this talk:</p>
<ol>
  <li>â€œThe greatest obstacle to knowledge is not ignorance. It is the illusion of knowledgeâ€</li>
  <li>â€œWe all see the world with the prism of our expertiseâ€</li>
  <li>â€œIn pursuit of knowledge, everyday something is acquired. In the pursuit of wisdom, everyday something is droppedâ€</li>
</ol>
