<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Author seems to claim that due to 1st order approximation of Chebyshev polynomials
as the convolution filter, their expressive power might not be good</li>
  <li>thatâ€™s because this approximation, when applied to the special case of regular
graphs (2D images, eg), will lead to severely weak models</li>
  <li>But the <a href="https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks">main authors of the GCN</a>
paper also note that the Weisfeiler-Lehman algo also doesnâ€™t converge on
regular graphs!</li>
</ul>
