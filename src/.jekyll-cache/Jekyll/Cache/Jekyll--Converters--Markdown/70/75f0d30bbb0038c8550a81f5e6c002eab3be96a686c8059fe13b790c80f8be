<p>This online video course by Robin Hills introduces students to the concept of
Emotional Intelligence and why and how is it essential at work place. This
course can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-emotional-intelligence/">here</a>.
Given below are the raw notes I took while attending this course.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a way to combine thinking and feelings in order
to make better/creative decisions and to build authentic relationships. It
helps us with dealing with or controlling emotions too.</li>
  <li>an example EI response would be: praise in public, criticize in private</li>
  <li>EI is a set of social and emotional skills to
    <ul>
      <li>understand and express oneself</li>
      <li>develop and maintain meaningful social relationships</li>
      <li>cope with challenges in life</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>EI and IQ are NOT correlated
    <ul>
      <li>IQ is a measure of how smart you are</li>
      <li>EQ (Emotional Quotient) is a measure of how well can you use that smartness</li>
      <li>EI typically grows with age, whereas IQ growth peaks at ~17yrs</li>
      <li>aka EQ is a measure of EI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>EQ refers to the quantifiable aspects of EI</li>
  <li>EI mainly deals with inter and intra personal skills which are important for
personal success</li>
  <li>We should enjoy and use our emotions for our best, not become enslaved by them</li>
  <li>basic emotions (from Paul Ekman)
    <ul>
      <li>happiness</li>
      <li>fear</li>
      <li>anger</li>
      <li>sadness</li>
      <li>disgust</li>
      <li>surprise</li>
      <li>contempt (was added later)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>more complex emotions are formed by mixing of these (just like colors)</li>
  <li>even though these are the basic ones, everyone ‚Äúfeels‚Äù about their emotions
differently and it is essential that we learn to pin-point the correct one</li>
  <li>Plutchik‚Äôs wheel of emotions shows a nice interaction between basic emotions</li>
  <li>EI at work is NOT about
    <ul>
      <li>supressing emotions (but about raising those emotions and working with them)</li>
      <li>being nice (but about doing the right thing and making the right decisions)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>how you think about a situation depends on how you feel and vice-versa. Thus
emotional management and engagement are very essential</li>
  <li>giving feedback
    <ul>
      <li>feedbacks should help not hurt</li>
      <li>provide constructive criticism</li>
      <li>ask before they tell</li>
      <li>be honest and specific</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>receiving feedback
    <ul>
      <li>listen</li>
      <li>don‚Äôt make excuses or deny</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>emotions are always involved when we interact with everyone, even while trying
to access from our memories</li>
  <li>poor ability to read other‚Äôs emotions leads to poor social skills</li>
  <li>emotions are higher-order states that momentarily pass through limbic region
    <ul>
      <li>conscious experiences are observed in the cortex region</li>
      <li>unconscious inputs come from limbic region as inputs to cortex region to
become conscious experiences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>just looking at an image to read another person‚Äôs image is not enough and
we‚Äôll require some more context at times
    <ul>
      <li>people with Mobius syndrome will appear to have a mask-like face</li>
      <li>so, we cannot judge a person‚Äôs emotions just by looking at their face alone</li>
      <li>some expression of emotions are cultural even</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>emotions
    <ul>
      <li>are a complex set of feelings</li>
      <li>cause physical/physiological changes</li>
      <li>alter our thought process and behavior</li>
      <li>are highly subjective</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>there are no positive/negative emotions, it is the thought process and
behavior that they trigger which require such labels
    <ul>
      <li>happiness can‚Äôt be expressed in all occassions, eg: funeral</li>
      <li>happiness can‚Äôt help during negotiation or critical thinking</li>
      <li>anger can be used to right a wrong</li>
      <li>sadness helps us to be thankful and move on from our loss</li>
      <li>fear helps us avoid taking unnecessary risks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>understanding and working with emotions
    <ul>
      <li>we should recognize what kind of events/circumstances generate what kind of
feelings in us</li>
      <li>we should develop the capacity to generate the right emotions in order to
focus, reason and communicate</li>
      <li>identifying how we feel and how others feel</li>
      <li>what kind of music/art makes me happy/calm/sad etc</li>
      <li>learn to to detect real vs fake feelings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Daniel Goleman‚Äôs framework for EI
    <ul>
      <li>motivation - drive to work and succeed (some people are motivated by money)</li>
      <li>self-awareness - understanding of ones strengths and weakness</li>
      <li>self-regulation - managing one‚Äôs own emotions (think before you act)</li>
      <li>empathy - understanding from another‚Äôs PoV</li>
      <li>social skills - working with others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li>perceiving emotions - self and others</li>
      <li>using emotions - to facilitate thinking and problem solving</li>

  <li>six seconds model?</li>
  <li>improving EI
    <ul>
      <li>I‚Äôm responsible for my own feelings and behavior</li>
      <li>I always have choices on how to respond</li>
      <li>No one can make me express my emotions unless I choose to do so</li>
      <li>Identify my choices empowers me with a fresh perspective on how to behave</li>
      <li>recognizing my range of choices is an excellent way to start chaning my
behavior for the better</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>practising EI
    <ul>
      <li>tune into your emotions (what are you experiencing physically? what are you
feeling?)</li>
      <li>look at the layers of feeling (there could be multiple feelings happening)</li>
      <li>Deliberately choose a feeling and intensify it</li>
      <li>look at optimism with realism</li>
      <li>ask yourself (is this a factual issue or relationship issue?)</li>
      <li>when you are feeling uncertain ask yourself, what will create the most value
for all?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>one percent solution
    <ul>
      <li>identify something that‚Äôs a very small but slight improvement and make it an
unconscious habit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we always try to dwelve on bad things (aka negative bias). This is one of the
main reasons for a lower EI. One way to improve is the ‚Äúthree good things‚Äù
method (probably do it at the end of each day)
    <ul>
      <li>think about anything good that has happened to you recently</li>
      <li>write 3 such good things</li>
      <li>reflect on why each of those good things have happened</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
