    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This online video course by Chris Croft talks about various practical ways to
reduce anxiety and stress in our lives. This course can
be found <a href="https://udemy.com/course/anxiety-and-stress/">here</a>. Given below
are the raw notes I took while attending this course.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>anxiety and stress are due to overload of things coming in at us, than what we
can deal with normally</li>
<li>there are unavoidable things like car breaking down, work pressure etc. That&#x27;s
just life and we have to learn to cope with those</li>
<li>avoidable overload
<ul>
<li>these are under our control</li>
<li>these might be the things that we are avoiding to confront</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ability to cope
<ul>
<li>inherent personality - some are better at coping with stress than others</li>
<li>acquried personality - we can do something about this</li>
<li>techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we need to reduce the amount of things coming in and improve our coping
abilities</li>
<li>detect your signs of anxiety and stress
<ul>
<li>behavioral signs (eg: evening creativity can be a sign of stress)</li>
<li>physical signs (eg: reduced energy and sex drive, procrastination, clumsy)</li>
<li>mental signs (eg: feeling of being overwhelmed, unable to concentrate,
sudden anger outburst)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we typically allow for these negative emotions to take place in our mind
thinking that those have some payoffs (eg: if I worry about the presentation
I will prepare better). But almost always those payoffs are false!</li>
<li>personality drivers (circular thought habits that cause anxiety)
<ul>
<li>pleasing others - Do the best you can and remember that you can&#x27;t please
everyone!</li>
<li>be perfect - remember that perfect is the enemy of good!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>work/home balance matrix (X = undesirable, ? = probably ok, Y = desirable)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>home\work  boring  secure  enjoyable  exciting  stressful
boring       X       X        X          X          X
secure       X       ?        Y          Y          X
enjoyable    X       Y        Y          Y          X
exciting     X       Y        Y          ?          X
stressful    X       X        X          X          X
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>life events can be stressful. However, most of us dont through those events
often. But we end up getting anxious over little things in our daily lives!</li>
<li>saying no
<ul>
<li>try to reduce the overall amount of commitment</li>
<li>don&#x27;t let the elements that breed anxiety in your life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>delegate the things that stress out (but there&#x27;s also a risk of you losing
that skill, over time!)</li>
<li>procrastination - our adult part of the mind wants to do that task whereas the
child part doesn&#x27;t. The trick is to make sure that the adult wins here. Some of
the following tricks can help you in this regard:
<ul>
<li>plunge in and start doing before the mind comes up with reasons to not doing
that work</li>
<li>give yourself plenty of energy reserves</li>
<li>put an appointment in your diary</li>
<li>make it a routine</li>
<li>break the task into manageable chunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>some coping mechanisms
<ul>
<li>make a list of things todo to help clear up your brain</li>
<li>remind yourself about the &quot;first world problems&quot;</li>
<li>make a plan for each item on this list</li>
<li>make contingency plans for things under your control</li>
<li>educate yourself on the topics that are bothering your</li>
<li>look at some of your risks as also potential opportunity for your growth</li>
<li>reach out to your support network for some help/support (there&#x27;s strength in
numbers!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>maintain 3 lists
<ul>
<li>a master list - for long term plans and goals</li>
<li>a todo list - for daily shor term items to get things done</li>
<li>calendar/diary - put all time sensitive things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>review your list at the end of every week (to check what happened this week
and plan for the next week)</li>
<li>differentiate the things that are under your control and the rest which aren&#x27;t
<ul>
<li>remove those that aren&#x27;t under your control</li>
<li>take necessary actions or precautions to the rest!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>setup a routine in the morning and in the evening. Routines help brain go in
the auto-pilot mode which can reduce anxiety</li>
</ul>
