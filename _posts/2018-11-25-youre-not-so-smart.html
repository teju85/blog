    <h3>The Book</h3>
<p>This book, written by David McRaney, is available
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this book David describes all our irrational behavior under the lens of
psychology.</p>
<ol>
<li>You
<ul>
<li>You are a rational logical being who sees the world as it really is.</li>
<li>You are as deluded as the rest of us, but that&#x27;s OK, it keeps you sane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Priming
<ul>
<li>You know you are being influenced and how it is affecting your behavior</li>
<li>You are unaware of the constant nudging you receive from ideas formed in your unconscious mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confabulation
<ul>
<li>You know when you&#x27;re lying to yourself.</li>
<li>You&#x27;re often ignorant of your motivations and created fictional narratives to explain your decisions, emotions and history without realizing it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirmation Bias
<ul>
<li>Your opinions are the result of years of rational, objective analysis.</li>
<li>Your opinions are the result of years of paying attention to information that confirmed what you believed, while ignoring information that challenged your preconceived notions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hindsight Bias
<ul>
<li>After you learn something new, you remember how you were once ignorant or wrong.</li>
<li>You often look back on the things you’ve just learned and assume you knew them or believed them all along.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
<ul>
<li>You take randomness into account when determining cause and effect.</li>
<li>You tend to ignore random chance when the results seem meaningful or when you want a random event to have a meaningful cause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procrastination
<ul>
<li>You procrastinate because you are lazy and can&#x27;t manage your time well.</li>
<li>Procrastination is fueled by weakness in the face of impulse and a failure to think about thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normalcy Bias
<ul>
<li>Your fight-or-flight instincts kick in and you panic when disaster strikes.</li>
<li>You often become abnormally calm and pretend everything is normal in a crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introspection
<ul>
<li>You know why you like the things you like and feel the way you feel.</li>
<li>The origin of certain emotional states is unavailable to you, and when pressed to explain them, you will just make something up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Availability Heuristic
<ul>
<li>With the advent of mass media, you understand how the world works based on statistics and facts culled from many examples.</li>
<li>You are far more likely to believe something is commonplace if you can find just one example of it, and you are far less likely to believe in something you&#x27;ve never seen or heard of before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Bystander Effect
<ul>
<li>When someone is hurt, people rush to their aid.</li>
<li>The more people who witness a person in distress, the less likely it is that any one person will help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Dunning-Kruger Effect
<ul>
<li>You can predict how well you would perform in any situation.</li>
<li>You are generally pretty bad at estimating your competence and the difficulty of complex tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apophenia
<ul>
<li>Some coincidences are so miraculous, they must have meaning.</li>
<li>Coincidences are a routine part of life, even the seemingly miraculous ones. Any meaning applied to them comes from your mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brand Loyalty
<ul>
<li>You prefer the things you own over the things you don&#x27;t because you made rational choices when you brought them.</li>
<li>You prefer the things you own because you rationalize your past choices to protect your sense of self.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Argument from Authority
<ul>
<li>You are more concerned with the validity of information than the person delivering it.</li>
<li>The status and credentials of an individual greatly influence your perception of that individual’s message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Argument from Ignorance
<ul>
<li>When you can&#x27;t explain something, you focus on what you can prove.</li>
<li>When you are unsure of something, you are more likely to accept strange explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Straw Man Fallacy
<ul>
<li>When you argue, you try to stick to the facts.</li>
<li>In any argument, anger will tempt you to reframe your opponent&#x27;s position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Ad Hominem Fallacy
<ul>
<li>If you can&#x27;t trust someone, you should ignore that person&#x27;s claims.</li>
<li>What someone says and why they say it should be judged separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Just-World Fallacy
<ul>
<li>People who are losing at the game of life must have done something to deserve it.</li>
<li>The beneficiaries of good fortune often do nothing to earn it, and bad people often get away with their actions without consequences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Public Goods Game
<ul>
<li>We could create a system with no regulations where everyone would contribute to the good of society, everyone would benefit, and everyone would be happy.</li>
<li>Without some form of regulation, slackers and cheaters will crash economic systems because people don&#x27;t want to feel like suckers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Ultimatum Game
<ul>
<li>You choose to accept or refuse an offer based on logic.</li>
<li>When it comes to making a deal, you base your decision on your status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subjective Validation
<ul>
<li>You are skeptical of generalities.</li>
<li>You are prone to believing vague statements and predictions are true, especially if they are positive and address you personally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cult Indoctrination
<ul>
<li>You are too smart to join a cult.</li>
<li>Cults are populated by people just like you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groupthink
<ul>
<li>Problems are easier to solve when a group of people get together to discuss solutions.</li>
<li>The desire to reach consensus and avoid confrontation hinders progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supernormal Releasers
<ul>
<li>Men who have sex with RealDolls are insane, and women who marry eighty-year-old billionaires are gold diggers.</li>
<li>The RealDoll and rich old sugar daddies are both supernormal releasers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Affect Heuristic
<ul>
<li>You calculate what is risky or rewarding and always choose to maximize gains while minimizing losses.</li>
<li>You depend on emotions to tell you if something is good or bad, greatly overestimate rewards, and tend to stick to your first impressions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dunbar&#x27;s Number
<ul>
<li>There is a Rolodex in your mind with the names and faces of everyone you&#x27;ve ever known.</li>
<li>You can maintain relationships and keep up with only around 150 people at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Selling Out
<ul>
<li>Both consumerism and capitalism are sustained by corporations and advertising.</li>
<li>Both consumerism and capitalism are driven by competition among consumers for status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Serving Bias
<ul>
<li>You evaluate yourself based on past successes and defeats.</li>
<li>You excuse your failures and see yourself as more successful, more intelligent, and more skilled than you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Spotlight Effect
<ul>
<li>When you are around others, you feel as if everyone is noticing every aspect of your appearance and behavior.</li>
<li>People devote little attention to you unless prompted to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Third Person Effect
<ul>
<li>You believe your opinions and decisions are based on experience and facts, while those who disagree with you are falling for the lies and propaganda of sources you don&#x27;t trust.</li>
<li>Everyone believes the people they disagree with are gullible, and everyone thinks they are far less susceptible to persuasion than they truly are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Catharsis
<ul>
<li>Venting your anger is an effective way to reduce stress and prevent lashing out at friends and family.</li>
<li>Venting increases aggressive behavior over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Misinformation Effect
<ul>
<li>Memories are played back like recordings.</li>
<li>Memories are constructed anew each time from whatever information is currently available, which makes them highly permeable to influences from the present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conformity
<ul>
<li>You are a strong individual who doesn’t conform unless forced to.</li>
<li>It takes a little more than an authority figure or social pressure to get you to obey, because conformity is a survival instinct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extinction Burst
<ul>
<li>If you stop engaging in a bad habit, the habit will gradually diminish until it disappears from your life.</li>
<li>Any time you quit something cold turkey, your brain will make a last-ditch effort to return you to your habit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Loafing
<ul>
<li>When you are joined by others in a task, you work harder and become more accomplished.</li>
<li>Once part of a group, you tend to put in less effort because you know your work will be pooled together with others&#x27;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Illusion of Transparency
<ul>
<li>When your emotions run high, people can look at you and tell what you are thinking and feeling.</li>
<li>Your subjective experience is not observable, and you overestimate how much you telegraph your inner thoughts and emotions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learned Helplessness
<ul>
<li>If you are in a bad situation, you will do whatever you can do to escape it.</li>
<li>If you feel like you aren’t in control of your destiny, you will give up and accept whatever situation you are in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embodied Cognition
<ul>
<li>Your opinions of people and events are based on objective evaluation.</li>
<li>You translate your physical world into words, and then believe those words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anchoring Effect
<ul>
<li>You rationally analyze all factors before making a choice or determining value.</li>
<li>Your first perception lingers in your mind, affecting later perceptions and decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attention
<ul>
<li>You see everything going on before your eyes, taking in all the information like a camera.</li>
<li>You are aware only of a small amount of the total information your eyes take in, and even less is processed by your conscious mind and remembered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Handicapping
<ul>
<li>In all you do, you strive for success.</li>
<li>You often create conditions for failure ahead of time to protect your ego.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
<ul>
<li>Predictions about your future are subject to forces beyond your control.</li>
<li>Just believing a future event will happen can cause it to happen if the event depends on human behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Moment
<ul>
<li>You are one person, and your happiness is based on being content with your life.</li>
<li>You are multiple selves, and happiness is based on satisfying all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistency Bias
<ul>
<li>You know how your opinions have changed over time.</li>
<li>Unless you consciously keep tabs on your progress, you assume the way you feel now is the way you have always felt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Representativeness Heuristic
<ul>
<li>Knowing a person&#x27;s history makes it easier to determine what sort of person they are.</li>
<li>You jump to conclusions based on how representative a person seems to be of a preconceived character type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expectation
<ul>
<li>Wine is a complicated elixir, full of subtle flavors only an expert can truly distinguish, and experienced tasters are impervious to deception.</li>
<li>Wine experts and consumers can be fooled by altering their expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Illusion of Control
<ul>
<li>You know how much control you have over your surroundings.</li>
<li>You often believe you have control over outcomes that are either random or are too complex to predict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Fundamental Attribution Error
<ul>
<li>Other people&#x27;s behavior is the reflection of their personality.</li>
<li>Other people&#x27;s behavior is more the result of the situation than their disposition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
