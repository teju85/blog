<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>

<li>some points about self-discipline:
<ul>
<li>it is not something your born with, but have developed through practice
and hardwork.</li>
<li>bad experiences in our past prohibit us from thinking positively and shape
negative behaviours in us</li>
<li>fear of failing often keeps us from taking initiatives, which keeps us from
developing self-discipline</li>
<li>having low self-esteem and self-confidence will make you unaware of your
strengths in getting things done</li>
<li>lack of purpose or a goal in life can also make you lose self-discipline</li>
</ul>
