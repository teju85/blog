    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>WSL2, although provides a nice unix-y abilities while on windows, still has quite
a bit of rough edges! This collects all the issues I have faced with WSL2 and
some fixes/workarounds that others have suggested. Since this</p>
<h3>prevent /etc/resolv.conf from getting overwritten</h3>
<p>This file is responsible for containing your DNS information. By default, this
gets overwritten upon every shutdown/startup. To fix this, you need the following
lines put inside <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code>: <code>generateResolvConf = false</code>. IOW:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tee /etc/wsl.conf &lt;&lt; EOF
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>I <em>think</em> this requires a shutdown/startup of WSL2.</p>
<h3>/etc/resolv.conf gets deleted upon shutdown/startup</h3>
<p>This happens even after one has updated the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> to explicitly prevent
the OS from rewriting this file upon startup! Full issue can be found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/6977">here</a>. This seems to be a
regression in WSL2. So, for now, the solution is to make this file
write-protected by doing: <code>sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf</code>. Obviously, this
means that you wont be able to modify this file later as well! So, you&#x27;ll have
to remove the write protection before modifying this file and then adding it
back afterwards.</p>
<h3>Network not working (while NOT on VPN)</h3>
<p>This is one of the common issues. If you are NOT on VPN, then you need to make
sure that the DNS server as shown by your windows command <code>ipconfig /all</code> has
been updated inside the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. If your system has Intel WiFi adapter
then the following <em>powershell</em> command gives you the DNS servers (<a href="https://gist.github.com/pyther/b7c03579a5ea55fe431561b502ec1ba8">Reference</a>):</p>
<pre><code>(Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object InterfaceDescription -like &quot;Intel*&quot; | Get-DnsClientServerAddress).ServerAddresses
</code></pre>
<h3>Network not working (while on VPN)</h3>
<p>Same as above, but you can use the following command (for eg if you are using
Cisco&#x27;s AnyConnect VPN) to know the DNS servers:</p>
<pre><code>(Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object InterfaceDescription -like &quot;Cisco*&quot; | Get-DnsClientServerAddress).ServerAddresses
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, I have noticed that it helps to also add the <code>domain</code> directive
which helps resolve short hostnames, if some of the URIs you are using while on
VPN connection could be shortened.</p>
<h3>After a shutdown, fresh WSL2 instance fails with <code>The Windows Subsystem for Linux instance has terminated.</code></h3>
<p>TODO: haven&#x27;t yet found a reliable solution that worked for me!</p>
<h3>Fresh WSL2 instance takes quite a bit of time to start</h3>
<p>Basically, everytime I start a fresh WSL2 instance (for eg: after a
<code>wsl --shutdown</code>), I have noticed that it takes almost 5-10 seconds before the
commandline shows up. I have seen this happening only after my upgrade to Windows 11.</p>
<p>TODO: haven&#x27;t yet found a reliable solution that worked for me!</p>
