    <p>After my research on Scalable Capital (SC), as of 25.12.2021, these were some of
its features I came across, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows moving your portfolio from other brokers like Trade Republic (TR). It
doesn&#x27;t involve any cost, but can take some time.</li>
<li>In case you&#x27;re switching countries (inside EU zone), they allow you to do so.
However, TR, for eg, will not. But moving countries means your tax ID will
change, and this you&#x27;ll have to get it done only via writing to the customer
support.</li>
<li>Savings plan doesn&#x27;t cost anything across all their different subscriptions.
One can start in this plan with only 1 Euro as well!</li>
<li>You can also create as many savings plans as you want</li>
<li>In savings plan they also allow you to provide a SEPA debit mandate to
transfer money from your current account to your brokerage account at regular
intervals.</li>
<li>You can quit the contract at any time</li>
<li>SC has both mobile and laptop apps</li>
<li>No extra cost for opening the account</li>
<li>Transferring money from your current account to savings account can take more
than a business day. So, one needs to factor that!</li>
<li>They do TDS on your profits and submit it to the local income tax department
and provide you with a tax report for filing purposes. No charges are applied!</li>
<li>They keep their brokerage with Baader Bank</li>
<li>Only supports investing in exchanges inside Germany (eg: if you&#x27;re in Germany)
unlike other neobrokers like flatex</li>
<li>Allow you to setup Freistellungsauftrag to benefit from the Freibetrag (eg:
801 Euros)</li>
<li>You need to have a current account in the SEPA region in order to open an
account with them. Most of the nationalities are supported, unlike TR.</li>
<li>They offer 3 kinds of subscriptions:
<ul>
<li>Free Broker - No subscription fee, only pay when you buy/sell or have more
savings plans</li>
<li>Prime Broker - 2.99 Euros per month (but paid annually), only pay when you
buy/sell with orders less than 250 Euros</li>
<li>Prime Broker flex - 4.99 Euros per month (paid monthly), only pay when you
buy/sell with orders less than 250 Euros</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are investing in Prime-ETF&#x27;s directly, they don&#x27;t charge any commission
on the orders greater than 250 Euros, even under Free broker subscription.
Irrespective of how many savings plan you have with any of ETF&#x27;s from any
prime partners</li>
</ul>
