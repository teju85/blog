    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In his book, Om Swami describes in full detail how to do Gayatri Mantra Sadhana.
This book can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Power-Gayatri-Mantra-potential/dp/9388423240">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>we become the kind of people we surround ourselves with</li>
<li>we speak our words carefully, use our resources judiciously to help ourselves
and those around us and be eternally grateful for everything in our lives</li>
<li>Om Swami starts with the story of how King Kaushika became Brahmarshi
Vishwamitra and the sacred Gayatri mantra was revealed to him. More on this
story can be read <a href="https://sanjay-koul.blogspot.com/2015/04/sage-vishvamitra-gayatri-mantra.html?m=1">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.hinduscriptures.com/hindu-lifestyle/king-kaushika-sage-vishwamitra/31242/">here</a></li>
<li>few nice words of wisdom from sage Vasishtha to King Kaushika:
<ul>
<li>the one who does not seek or need anything from this world can create anything he wishes.</li>
<li>you are not defined by what you have or what you can do, but by who you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there&#x27;s little hope for a person who&#x27;s dark from the inside</li>
<li>When you are fulfilled, you can manifest fairly much anything in your
life. Itâ€™s when we are not fulfilled that we become impatient; we become
self-centered. We become tired and narrow-minded. In chasing what we could
have had, we lose sight of what we already have</li>
<li>Purity and light are synonyms of enlightenment, of freedom; while the impure
is trapped and confined, the pure is eternally liberated</li>
<li>four kinds of chanting
<ul>
<li>vachika - chanting out aloud. Can quickly tire you and also can cause
restlessness when done over long periods of time</li>
<li>upanshu - only lip movements to be seen along with a whisper</li>
<li>manasika - it is not chanting the mantra in your mind, but actually
recalling it</li>
<li>ajapa - a state where the mantra is chanting itself!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you get upset very quickly, that means you are not progressing spiritually</li>
<li>You chant a mantra because you want to invoke the divinity within; to gain
immense inner strength; to constantly purify yourself.</li>
<li>a good prayer never asks God for anything (that&#x27;s actually begging!). It
instead should only express gratitude</li>
<li>3 forms of mantra sadhana:
<ul>
<li>nitya karma - aka daily routine. Helps refresh what you&#x27;ve learnt</li>
<li>naimittika karma - sort of a FD in your spiritual bank account. You chant
certain mantra for a certain number of times in a given period and store
it&#x27;s energy to be used later (aka purushacharana)</li>
<li>kamya prayoga - chanting mantra for fulfilling certain desire</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when you are lazy, breathe from the right nostril and it&#x27;ll invigorate you</li>
<li>when you are angry, breathe from the left nostril and it&#x27;ll clam you down</li>
<li>different types of invocations:
<ul>
<li>laghu purushacharana - duration of 3-9 days with atleast 1k chanting each day</li>
<li>sadharana purushacharana - 40-120 days with a minimum total count of 100k.</li>
<li>asadharana purushacharana - 18-24 months with an exact total count of 2.4M</li>
<li>maha purushacharana - 24-32 months with an exact total count of 3.2M
comprehensive invocation has full 36 steps while the brief one has only 7</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
