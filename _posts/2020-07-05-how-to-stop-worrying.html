    <p>By Dale Carnegie. This book can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.in/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354">here</a>.</p>
<p>Carnegie walks us through a list of time-tested rules/ideas/guidelines to help
us stop our greatest enemy, worry. When you have gone through this list, you&#x27;ll
realize that this is nothing novel and everyone before us have been trying to
tell us the same thing! However, the uniqueness in his book is that he shows us
the examples from real people who have been able to put some of these techniques
in order to conquer their worries.</p>
<h3>intro</h3>
<ul>
<li>leadership gravitates towards those who can stand up and speak what they are
thinking</li>
</ul>
<h3>live in &quot;day-tight compartments&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thomas Carlyle: our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance,
but to do what lies clearly at hand</li>
<li>today&#x27;s bread is the only kind of bread you can possibly eat. By all means
prepare for tomorrow, but don&#x27;t have anxiety about it</li>
<li>anyone can do their job or handle their responsibilities for one day</li>
<li>everyday is a new life to a wise man</li>
</ul>
<h3>a magic formula for solving worry situations</h3>
<ul>
<li>3-step solution to come out of worry and anxiety: (Carrier formula)
<ul>
<li>Step1: imagine the worst that could happen</li>
<li>Step2: reconcile with the worst case</li>
<li>Step3: calmly start working towards solutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>what worry may do to you</h3>
<ul>
<li>people who don&#x27;t know how to fight worry, die young</li>
<li>you don&#x27;t get stomach ulcers from you eat, but from what&#x27;s eating you</li>
</ul>
<h3>how to analyse and solve worry problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>six honest men: what, when, why, how, where and who - Rudyard Kipling</li>
<li>basic steps in problem analysis
<ul>
<li>get the facts</li>
<li>analyze the facts</li>
<li>come to a decision and then act on it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>confusion is the chief cause of worry</li>
<li>if one gathers all the facts in an objective way, the problem usually solves
itself!</li>
<li>it is hard to collect facts when our emotions are running high due to worry.
So, do this:
<ul>
<li>think that you are collecting these facts for another person</li>
<li>now pretend that you are a lawyer trying to bring you down and collect all
facts against you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a problem well stated is problem half solved</li>
<li>but once the decision has been made, don&#x27;t self-doubt</li>
</ul>
<h3>how to eliminate 50% of your business worries</h3>
<ul>
<li>answer these questions:
<ul>
<li>what is the problem?</li>
<li>what is its cause?</li>
<li>what are all the possible solutions?</li>
<li>what solution do you recommend?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>how to crowd worry out of your mind</h3>
<ul>
<li>keeping yourself busy can drive out anxiety</li>
<li>remember: idle mind is devil&#x27;s workshop!</li>
<li>worried person must lose himself in action, lest be wither in despair</li>
</ul>
<h3>don&#x27;t let the beetles get you down</h3>
<ul>
<li>we often face the most difficult hardships with extreme courage, but always
let us down due to silly trifles!</li>
<li>only few of us are greatly wronged. It is the small hurt to our ego which lead
to fights and murders</li>
<li>a giant tree withstands centuries of avalanche and storms, only to be brought
down due to incessant attacks by tiny insects and beetles!</li>
<li>don&#x27;t dwell on trifles. Life is too short to be little.</li>
</ul>
<h3>a law that will outlaw many of your worries</h3>
<ul>
<li>most of our worries are due to imagination</li>
<li>when you find yourself worrying about some possibility ask yourself, what&#x27;s
the chance of it happening</li>
</ul>
<h3>co-operate with the inevitable</h3>
<ul>
<li>it is so. It can&#x27;t be otherwise</li>
<li>when unpleasant things happen to us, we can either accept them and adjust
ourselves or live a life of rebellion</li>
<li>acceptance of what has happened is the first step towards overcoming the
consequences of a misfortune</li>
<li>circumstances alone do not make us happy or unhappy, but our reactions.</li>
<li>it&#x27;s only miserable of we cannot endure our circumstances</li>
<li>this doesn&#x27;t mean we should shy away from adversities! It means when we have a
chance a fighting back we must.</li>
<li>when I can&#x27;t handle events, I let them handle themselves - Ford</li>
</ul>
<h3>put a &quot;stop-loss&quot; order on your worries</h3>
<ul>
<li>just like we put a stop-loss order on the purchased shares to minimize loss,
we should do the same on our worries, impatience, etc.</li>
<li>things happen, but we shouldn&#x27;t be paying them back at the cost of our peace
of mind.</li>
<li>most of our miseries are due to the false estimates we have on things</li>
<li>when you find yourself worrying too much, ask yourself:
<ul>
<li>what is it worth to me</li>
<li>at what price should I put a stop-loss order on it</li>
<li>have I already paid enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>don&#x27;t try to saw sawdust</h3>
<ul>
<li>there&#x27;s only one way to benefit from our past, ie to calmly analyze it for any
mistakes, benefit from it and forget it!</li>
<li>don&#x27;t cry over spilt milk!
<ul>
<li>all the fuss and cry in the world will not bring back that milk</li>
<li>we can only try to avoid trying to get it spilt the next time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>let the past bury it&#x27;s dead</li>
</ul>
<h3>eight words that can transform your life</h3>
<ul>
<li>our mental attitude is the X factor that determines our fate</li>
<li>thus out biggest problem is choosing the right thoughts!</li>
<li>our life is what our thoughts make it</li>
<li>we need to b concerned about our problems, not worried</li>
<li>Our mental thoughts can also affect our physical powers</li>
<li>nothing can bring you peace but yourself</li>
<li>think and act cheerfully and you will fell cheerful</li>
</ul>
<h3>high cost of getting even</h3>
<ul>
<li>we don&#x27;t have to be saintly and love our enemies. But atleast, for our own
health&#x27;s sake, let us forgive them and forget them</li>
<li>a man is a fool who can&#x27;t be angry, but a man is wise who won&#x27;t be angry</li>
<li>no one or thing can humiliate or disturb us, unless we let them</li>
<li>one way to not hate our attackers is to have mission much bigger than
ourselves and be completely involved towards it</li>
</ul>
<h3>if you do this, you&#x27;ll never worry about ingratitude</h3>
<ul>
<li>an angry man is always full of poison</li>
<li>it is natural for man to forget to be grateful</li>
<li>the biggest mistake we make is to expect gratitude in return to our supposed
good deeds</li>
<li>both gratitude and love can&#x27;t be demanded</li>
<li>ingratitude is our nature. So, gratitude as a quality needs to be cultivated
from an early age</li>
<li>our children will become what we make them to be</li>
<li>if we want our children to be grateful, then we should be grateful</li>
</ul>
<h3>Would You Take A Million Dollars For What You Have?</h3>
<ul>
<li>~90% of things in our lives are right. So, if you want to be worry-free, then
concentrate on these</li>
<li>think and thank: think of all things you are grateful if and thank God for them</li>
<li>we seldom think of what we have but what we lack</li>
<li>Count your blessings not your troubles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find Yourself And Be Yourself: Remember There Is No One Else on Earth Like You</h3>
<ul>
<li>we bring a lot of misery upon ourselves by trying to fit in someone else&#x27;s shoes</li>
<li>you won&#x27;t get far by playing ape</li>
</ul>
<h3>if you have a lemon, make lemonade</h3>
<ul>
<li>one of humanity&#x27;s greatest powers is to turn a minus into a plus</li>
<li>a superior man not only bears up under necessity, but loves it</li>
<li>anybody can capitalise on their gains. The real challenge is in turning our
loses into profit.</li>
<li>our infirmities help us unexpectedly</li>
</ul>
<h3>how to cure melancholy in 14 days</h3>
<ul>
<li>the cure is simple: everyday try to think how to make someone happy</li>
<li>doing so helps to take off the focus on ourselves</li>
<li>when you&#x27;re good to others, you are best to yourself</li>
</ul>
<h3>how my mother and father conquered worry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Man is made not to understand life, but to live it</li>
<li>sovereign cure for worry is religious faith</li>
<li>faith is one of the forces by which man lives. thus an absence of it leads to
a total collapse</li>
<li>Prayer:
<ul>
<li>helps by putting our problems into concrete words</li>
<li>helps by giving us a feeling that we are not alone</li>
<li>it is the first action towards fixing our problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>remember that no one ever kicks a dead dog</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you&#x27;re getting kicking and criticized, it basic means that you&#x27;re
accomplishing something important</li>
<li>vulgar people take huge delight in the faults and follies of great people</li>
<li>unjust criticism is actually a disguised compliment</li>
</ul>
<h3>do this and the criticism can&#x27;t hurt you</h3>
<ul>
<li>We take the little jibes taken at us, far too seriously!</li>
<li>in the long run, it&#x27;s pointless to keep scores</li>
<li>if you put your head above the crowd you&#x27;ll be criticized. So, just learn to
ignore unjust criticism</li>
</ul>
<h3>fool things I have done</h3>
<ul>
<li>we ourselves are to be blamed for our misfortunes, no one else</li>
<li>setting up a regular and continued self-analysis process is very helpful in
helping us grow</li>
<li>every man is a fool for atleast 5 minutes in a day. Wisdom lies in not
exceeding that limit!</li>
<li>opinions of our enemies come closer to the truth than those of ourselves.</li>
<li>if the criticism is genuine and done with honest intentions, no matter who
gives them, we need to take them seriously</li>
<li>We are not perfect. So let&#x27;s ask for unbiased and constructive criticism</li>
</ul>
