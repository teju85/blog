    <h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>This is my summary of the in-memory interval join paper which can be found
<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00778-020-00639-0.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>improve perf of single threaded interval joins, without having to use any
special data structures (unlike EBI method)</li>
<li>parallelize this approach with the help of a novel domain-based data
partitioning technique</li>
</ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>instead of going with the plane-sweep method based Endpoint Based Interval
join (EBI) algorithm (which requires a special gapless hash map) for doing
interval joins, they propose to use a forward-scan (FS) based approach.</li>
<li>FS uses sweeps in the order of start points, whereas the above mentioned PS
based method does sweeps on the sorted end points.</li>
<li>Overall complexity is $$O(R + S + R \Join S)$$
<ul>
<li>$$R$$ = number of ranges in set R</li>
<li>$$S$$ = number of ranges in set S</li>
<li>$$R \Join S$$ = number of resulting ranges in the set after joining R and S</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EBI (Endpoint Based Interval join)
<ul>
<li>sort the ranges based on their values first and then by them being start or
end values for the range</li>
<li>then perform a sweep based on the range value and continue to collect the
intersecting ranges</li>
<li>along with lazy evaluation (collect multiple consecutive active ranges from
one set and then do a single scan on the opposite set of active ranges) this
approach also beats PS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PS (Plane Sweep)
<ul>
<li>sort based on the start interval of R, S sets</li>
<li>sweep a line through every start point and collect all intersecting ranges
from the other set</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimizations to FS
<ul>
<li>in the above complexity, the first two terms can&#x27;t be reduced, however the
third item can be</li>
<li>grouping
<ul>
<li>FS compares every interval from one set with every other in the active set</li>
<li>this optimization basically eliminates these comparisons as if the ranges
are in the active set, they must anyways overlap</li>
<li>while implementing, just copying the groups into another buffer was faster
due to less cache misses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bucket indexing
<ul>
<li>further reduces the comparisons by splitting the x-axis into equal sized
buckets.</li>
<li>All bucket indices until the one containing the end range doesn&#x27;t require
any comparisons with the ranges from the other set that fall into these
buckets</li>
<li>while implementing, bucket indices are not materialized</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>enhanced loop unrolling
<ul>
<li>unroll the inner scan loop and also do the range comparison only once per
unrolled iteration. Only when the comparison fails, all the unrolled cases
in the current iteration are compared.</li>
<li>this further reduces the comparisons required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>decomposed data layout
<ul>
<li>store the structures in SoA format, thereby improving cache access patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>optFS
<ul>
<li>also propose a self-tuning version of the algo that initially samples the
input data and then tries to estimate the cost of a forward scan.</li>
<li>if the FS covers only a few tens to a hundred ranges, then it is just enough
to run unrolled FS, else it enables all 4 of the above optimizations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parallelization
<ul>
<li>no-partioning
<ul>
<li>means data is not partitioned but stored in shared main memory and all the
threads traverse the data in this memory region simultaneously</li>
<li>they design a master-slave approach for this</li>
<li>master thread advances the sweep line</li>
<li>for each &quot;stoppage&quot; of the sweep line, it assigns the next available thread
for finding the joins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hash-based partitioning
<ul>
<li>partition each range (based on the hash value)</li>
<li>for all partition pairs between first and second sets perform the join</li>
<li>rule-of-thumb is to set $$k = \sqrt nc$$ where $$nc$$ is the number of
cores on which to parallelize</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>domain-based partioning
<ul>
<li>each set is divided into &#x27;k&#x27; non-overlapping regions</li>
<li>every range that is inside a region will be assigned that region, so there
could be a range that belongs to multiple regions!</li>
<li>rule-of-thumb is to set $$k = nc$$ where $$nc$$ is the number of cores on
which to parallelize</li>
<li>this requires quadratically fewer joins that hash-based partition method</li>
<li>we&#x27;ll however need to de-duplicate the join results</li>
<li>they also propose various load balancing techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
