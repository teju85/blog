The pdf version of this book/chapter is available <a href="https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf">here</a></p> <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3> <ul> <li>software arch is multi-tiered <ul> <li>At the highest level, there are the architecture patterns that define the overall shape and structure of software applications.</li> <li>Down a level is the architecture that is specifically related to the purpose of the software application.</li> <li>Yet another level down resides the architecture of the modules and their interconnections. This is the domain of design patterns, packages, components, and classes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>four symptoms of rotting design: rigidity, fragility, immobility, and viscosity. <ul> <li>rigidity: tendency for the sw to be difficult to change</li> <li>fragility: tendency of sw to break at many places even on a simple change</li> <li>immobility: inability to reuse parts of other or the same project</li> <li>viscosity of design: when design preserving solutions are harder to implement than hacks</li> <li>viscosity of environment: development environment is inefficient</li> </ul> </li> <li>reasons for sw rot <ul> <li>changing reqs</li> <li>bad dependency management</li> </ul> </li> <li>OCP: open closed principle <ul> <li>A module should be open for extension but closed for modification</li> <li>the most important rule of sw design</li> <li>abstraction is the key to OCP</li> <li>achieved through runtime and static polymorphism</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you don’t have to change working code, you aren’t likely to break it.</li> <li>LSP: liskov substitution principle <ul> <li>Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.</li> <li>best paradox for this is circle/ellipse dillema <ul> <li>designing circle to inherit from ellipse is fine</li> <li>but users of this code will ruin everything when one wants to pass ellipse-like args to a circle object! (think about foci)</li> </ul> </li> <li>thus the contract of base class must be obeyed by the child class</li> </ul> </li> <li>contract of a method consists of precondition and postcondtion</li> <li>restating LSP in terms of contracts <ul> <li>derived class is substitutable for its base class if: <ul> <li>Its preconditions are no stronger than the base class method.</li> <li>Its postconditions are no weaker than the base class method.</li> <li>in other words, derived methods should expect no more and provide no less.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>violations of LSP are latent violations of OCP</li> <li>DIP: dependency inversion principle <ul> <li>Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.</li> <li>If the OCP states the goal of OO architecture, the DIP states the primary mechanism.</li> <li>No dependency should target a concrete class.</li> <li>concrete things change alot, abstract things change much less frequently</li> <li>abstractions are “hinge points”, they represent the places where the design can bend or be extended, without themselves being modified (OCP)</li> </ul> </li> <li>ISP: interface segregation principle. Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface</li> <li>PCP: package cohesion principles <ul> <li>REP: release reuse equivalency principle <ul> <li>The granule of reuse is the granule of release.</li> </ul> </li> <li>CCP: common closure principle <ul> <li>Classes that change together, belong together.</li> </ul> </li> <li>CRP: common reuse principle <ul> <li>Classes that aren’t reused together should not be grouped together.</li> </ul> </li> <li>these three principles are mutually exclusive. All of them cannot be simultaneously satisfied</li> </ul> </li> <li>PCP: package coupling principles <ul> <li>ADP: acyclic dependencies principle <ul> <li>The dependencies betwen packages must not form cycles</li> <li>Cycles can be broken in two ways. The first involves creating a new package, and the second makes use of the DIP and ISP</li> <li>Interfaces are very often included in the package that uses them, rather than in the package that implements them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>SDP: stable dependencies principle <ul> <li>Depend in the direction of stability.</li> <li>package stability measurement <ul> <li>Ca = Afferent Coupling. The number of classes outside the package that depend upon classes inside the package. (i.e. incoming dependencies)</li> <li>Ce = Efferent Coupling. The number of classes outside the package that classes inside the package depend upon. (i.e. outgoing dependencies)</li> <li>I = instability = Ce/(Ca+Ce)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Depend upon packages whose I metric is lower than yours</li> </ul> </li> <li>SAP: stable abstractions principle <ul> <li>Stable packages should be abstract packages.</li> <li>compose application from instable packages that are easy to change, and stable packages that are easy to extend.</li> <li>abstractness metric: <ul> <li>Nc = Number of classes in the package.</li> <li>Na = Number of abstract classes in the package. Remember, an abstract class is a class with at least one pure interface, and cannot be instantiated.</li> <li>A Abstractness = Na / Nc</li> </ul> </li> <li>I should increase as A decreases</li> </ul> </li> <li>two zones in the IA graph <ul> <li>upper right corner = zone of uselessness = only abstract classes</li> <li>lower left corner = zone of pain = lots of dependencies = only concrete classes</li> <li>maximizing distance between these two zones gives us a line called main sequence</li> <li>ideally our packages should sit on this line</li> </ul> </li> <li>distance metric <ul> <li>D = Distance from main sequence = |A+I-1|/sqrt(2). This ranges from [0,~0.707].</li> <li>D’ = Normalized Distance = |A+I-1|. This metric is much more convenient than D since it ranges from [0,1]. Zero indicates that the package is directly on the main sequence. One indicates that the package is as far away as possible from the main sequence.</li> </ul> </li> <li>design patterns = repeating structures of design and architecture</li> <li>abstract server: when client depends directly on server DIP is violated. Thus create an interface which client uses but server implements</li> <li>adapter: delegator of methods from an abstract interface to the third party server implementation</li> <li>observer: when changes in one object needs to be informed to another without each knowing much about the other</li> <li>bridge: base and child classes are tightly coupled. This creates a strong separation between interface and implementation</li> <li>abstract factory: DIP strongly recommends that modules not depend upon concrete classes. However, in order ot create an instance of a class, you must depend upon the concrete class. This allows that dependency upon the concrete class to exist in one, and only one, place.</li> </ul> </div> <a class="u-url" href="/blog/2019/01/26/design-patterns.html" hidden></a> </article> </div> </main> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <h2 class="footer-heading">Quagmire</h2> <div class="footer-col-wrapper"> <div class="footer-col footer-col-1"> <ul class="contact-list"> <li> Quagmire </li> <li><a href="mailto:rao.thejaswi@gmail.com">rao.thejaswi@gmail.com</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-2"> <ul class="social-media-list"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/teju85"><span class="icon icon--github"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16px" height="16px"><path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/></svg> </span><span class="username">teju85</span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="footer-col footer-col-3"> <p>Stuff I find cool/useful</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
